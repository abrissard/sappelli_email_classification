# Email classification using LLMs on Sappelli dataset

This project is aimed at evaluating the capabilities of LLMs on email classification using a dataset from [Assessing e-mail intent and tasks in e-mail messages, *Sappelli et al.* (2016)(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025516301438#sec0003).

## Files Description

- `act1_train.ipynb`: Notebook for training the model on `act1` dataset.
- `numta_train.ipynb`: Notebook for training the model on `numta` dataset.
- `multi_label_classification.ipynb`: Notebook for training the model on `numta` dataset.
- `data/`: Directory containing all the datasets used in this project.
- `models/`: Directory where trained models are saved.
- `preprocessing/`: Directory containing notebooks for data preprocessing.
- `results/`: Directory where the results of model evaluation are saved.

## How to Run

1. Open the desired notebook file (`.ipynb`).
2. Run the cells in the notebook to load or train a model
3. Run the cells in the notebook to evaluate the model.

Please note that you might need to install necessary Python libraries to run the notebooks.
