"Paul, I hope you feel better. I have seen the message from Christian in which he confirmedthat he approached the Research in Houston on his own. He did notreceive any encouragement from me and from Mike. I hope this closes this issue. I can understand Christian s motivation but don t endorse the way he takes to reach his goals.He hopes to accomplish more in a larger group where he can have more interaction with his peerswho have similar backgrounds. I think also that he developed an appreciation for good interpersonal relations in my group he could observe during his stay in Houston. My advice is to try to figure out how to use his skills for Enron and how to develop his socialintelligence.

It will help to clarify a few issues. 1. I was contacted by Christian (this means I did not start this phase of the process)    last Friday, as far as I can remember.     Christian expressed interest in joining the Research Group. I told him two things:       a. We would be delighted to have him here.       b. Our mutual relationship and good practices require that he receives           your blessing before we can move ahead.    We agreed to have a conference call Wed morning, your time, with you, Christian and    Mike Roberts.   2. Wednesday call was subsequently cancelled by Christian. Mike and I decided to call you      anyway Thu morning your time, directly, to discuss the matter. I was in a PRC all afternoon and       asked Mike to call you  in case I could not sneak out to join him. Mike called and was      told you were out sick.  3. I am leaving in a few hours for California. I shall be driving back to Houston for the next     3 days. Please, feel free to call Mike an discuss this matter with  him in my absence.  4. I think Christian has a strong preference to be in the Research Group, assuming he moves to     Houston. I think he came to this conclusion after visiting Houston in early July. I did not      bring up the issue of transfer with him at all when he was here.      I can  understand his motivation and think we should take his preferences into account. But the     first  issue is if he can leave Sydney at all. I hope it helps. Cheers.

"	Terry, please review and let me know if this sounds OK.  Thanks. Lynn	We met with SoCal today to discuss the changes SoCal is making for	November 1.  Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW:	1.  SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless	     they have operational problems. And they will maintain 750 for a gas 	     day (during all cycles).  (Good news for TW)	2.  SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750.  If they do, they will	     maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there	     are specific operational problems. (Good news for TW)	   	4.  SoCal will have the option to call OFO s at the beginning of each cycle	     for the gas day.  Today they only call an OFO before the gas day begins.	     Starting Nov. 1, they can call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle,	     including Intraday 1 and Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day. (This	     will be a major impact to SoCal s customers)	5.  SoCal says the ""windowing"" is gone.  But, they are still giving us a	     capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations	     exceed their capacity.	6.  SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation.  This	     would be due to SoCal s market not burning their schedule.  At that	     time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn.

Who is handling(inside and outside)	Richard B Sanders	01/21/2001 10:23 AM		 		 To: Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT		 cc: 		 Subject: NGX Litigation and Outside Counsel----- Forwarded by Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT on 01/21/2001 10:27 AM -----	Peter Keohane	12/19/2000 10:09 PM		 		 To: James Derrick/Corp/Enron@ENRON		 cc: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT		 Subject: NGX Litigation and Outside CounselJim (and Richard) my apologies.  In the pace of the year-end I forgot to inform you of a piece of litigation commenced by Enron Canada.  The litigation is against NGX Canada Inc. and Canadian Enerdata, and their shareholders, Westcoast Energy and OM Groupen for NGX, and Richard Zarzeczny for Canadian Enerdata.It is somewhat complicated.  In brief, NGX operates an electronic natural gas trading brokerage which suffered competitively after the onset of Enron Online, and Enerdata publishes the only available and reliable natural gas indices for our market.  Traditionally the indices were based upon a comprehensive survey of fixed-price physical gas transactions over the broad market.  Presumably to coerce business onto the NGX system, and with two days  notice, NGX purchased the right to calculate the indices (as opposed to Enerdata itself or the publication itself) and changed the methodology for the indices to include only trades completed on NGX s system.  The result is the indices are, for contractual purposes, quite cleverly unchanged and therefore still as described in hundreds of our trading contracts and thousands of transactions, but in substance have been changed to represent only NGX s segment of the market, which introduces unmanageable volatility and unreliability, and is affected by other limitations such as the ability to trade with NGX for a variety of reasons, including credit restrictions or electronic failure. [ex.  We have contracts to buy and sell Coke, somebody bought the formula for Coke, changed it to Sprite, put the Sprite in the Coke can, such that we are now forced to buy and sell Sprite under the auspices of contracts to buy and sell Coke.]In any event, no commercial alternative was viable, and we decided to commence a law suit based upon interference with economic relations, interference with contractual relations, breach of obligations of good faith, civil conspiracy and passing off.  All are viable claims but difficult to prove.  We have to get past simply being outsmarted.  We have also decided not to involve regulators or antitrust enforcement.  The discovery process will be key, and we hope to influence a commercial result that includes all electronic trading systems, including Enron Online, into the indices. The lawsuit is for injunctive relief (which will be particularly difficult) and damages of C$100MM.  We hope to garner industry support, but to date and as usual, many parties agree with our position but are not willing to get involved.  Some competitors are also happy to segregate Enron Online from the rest of the market.In terms of counsel, we initially were going to use Robert Anderson of Blake Cassels & Graydon, who we have used on many matters, but Blakes was conflicted after the injunction papers were served.  We had to find replacement counsel on short notice and, with the recommendation of Blakes but based primarily on my prior experiences, retained Clarke Hunter of Macleod Dixon.My apologies for not letting you know sooner.

In the pace of the year-end I forgot to inform you of a piece of litigation commenced by Enron Canada.  The litigation is against NGX Canada Inc. and Canadian Enerdata, and their shareholders, Westcoast Energy and OM Groupen for NGX, and Richard Zarzeczny for Canadian Enerdata.It is somewhat complicated.  In brief, NGX operates an electronic natural gas trading brokerage which suffered competitively after the onset of Enron Online, and Enerdata publishes the only available and reliable natural gas indices for our market.  Traditionally the indices were based upon a comprehensive survey of fixed-price physical gas transactions over the broad market.  Presumably to coerce business onto the NGX system, and with two days  notice, NGX purchased the right to calculate the indices (as opposed to Enerdata itself or the publication itself) and changed the methodology for the indices to include only trades completed on NGX s system.  The result is the indices are, for contractual purposes, quite cleverly unchanged and therefore still as described in hundreds of our trading contracts and thousands of transactions, but in substance have been changed to represent only NGX s segment of the market, which introduces unmanageable volatility and unreliability, and is affected by other limitations such as the ability to trade with NGX for a variety of reasons, including credit restrictions or electronic failure. [ex.  We have contracts to buy and sell Coke, somebody bought the formula for Coke, changed it to Sprite, put the Sprite in the Coke can, such that we are now forced to buy and sell Sprite under the auspices of contracts to buy and sell Coke.]In any event, no commercial alternative was viable, and we decided to commence a law suit based upon interference with economic relations, interference with contractual relations, breach of obligations of good faith, civil conspiracy and passing off.  All are viable claims but difficult to prove.  We have to get past simply being outsmarted.  We have also decided not to involve regulators or antitrust enforcement.  The discovery process will be key, and we hope to influence a commercial result that includes all electronic trading systems, including Enron Online, into the indices. The lawsuit is for injunctive relief (which will be particularly difficult) and damages of C$100MM.  We hope to garner industry support, but to date and as usual, many parties agree with our position but are not willing to get involved.  Some competitors are also happy to segregate Enron Online from the rest of the market.In terms of counsel, we initially were going to use Robert Anderson of Blake Cassels & Graydon, who we have used on many matters, but Blakes was conflicted after the injunction papers were served.

It was my understanding that you wanted to keep this deal off their radar screen, as you didn t want them entering into the structuring picture until later.  We can ask for a blessing on the language, but that will probably lead to questions about how the deal will be structured, etc.  I am happy to access the resources in their group, however.FCE hasn t seen any of this language.  It was something I pulled together for you to look at.As for FCE s desire to assign in case of merger, etc, I think the language is too broad.

We are currently evaluating taking another cape on short period or fixing a COA with a distressed owner for our Q2 cargoes out of RBCT or Colombia or both.  The average earnings for a cape has fallen from a high of $25,000 in November to $18,500 today.  Pierre is in Japan next week and should get a good feel as to what the Japanese steel mills are up to and what kind of opportunities are out there for us to concentrate on.   Panamaxes as anticipated are very difficult to read with close to zero Far East biz. Atlantic very short term has slight imbalance of tonnage but backed by very good USDA corn sales yesterday, the grain will start to role by end Feb. Paper rates have remained stagnant again lacking real physical input, nearbys marginally easier forwards flat neglected. Strategy will either be to bear spread where nearby premiums are good or bide our time and buy Q2 dips or calls.The story out of Bocimar this week is that they view this year as being definitely weaker than last year and that they feel it should average around $15,000 to $17,000 for the year ( which is still a good market for shipping ) and at those levels, they are happy to sit back and watch.   Furthermore, last week CMB ( parent company of Bocimar ) released their earnings for cal 00.  Their Dry bulk division made 60 million Euro and their tanker division made 60 million as well.  These are very good numbers for their dry bulk division taking into account the incredible rise in bunkers last year ( cost of fuelling the ships ) and the fact that their ships were often at anchor and not generating revenues.On the funny side of things, Coeclerici is having their yearly audit by Arthur Anderson and AA has discovered that although Coeclerici makes money trading FFA s, they lack proper daily position reports and models to value options.  As a result, I got a call from Koert ( head shipping at Coaclerici ) asking for our assistance as AA had mentioned to them that they should talk to us about our systems and procedures.  Being that Coeclerici is our biggest counterpart, we jumped on the opportunity to assist and Andy James is being sent to genoa Tuesday for a one day tutorial about risk controls and procedures while trying at the same time to better understand how Coeclerici values deals, which needless to say should help us in the future when negotiating with them.

"X-FileName: andy zipper 6-26-02.PSTTravis:     Here  are my general comments on the May 1st draft of the TSH License Agreement  between Enron and Accenture.  I have not tried to provide detailed drafting  comments, but there are many, many problems with the draft.  I have limited  my comments to what I consider the bigger issues.  Some of my comments may  have already been addressed by Andy, but since I am starting fresh on this, I thought  that I would just comment on everything.  I look forward to talking with  you further about this.        1.    Which is the correct Enron entity?  I assume that this  should be an agreement with Enron Networks.  Does Accenture expect a parent  guaranty?  Does Accenture expect a broader exclusivity that binds Enron  Corp. and its affiliates?  I assume that we want to limit the scope of the  exclusivity to Enron Networks.      2.    The description of EnronOnline is much too broad ""various  goods and raw materials"".  This needs to be limited to certain  products.      3.    I don t understand why Accenture is licensing aggregate  data.  I thought the service to be established was to provide re-formatted  data to individual Enron customers.  That would require only  customer-specific data.      4.    Will Enron be receive ""real time"" data transfers?   Will this be true in the sense that it will be the same time as Enron transmits  information to the customer?  I assume that there may be a lag in time  between the completion of a transaction and the transmission of the transaction  data.      5.    In Section 2.1(a), the scope of the ""exclusive"" license  needs to be carefully thought through and narrowed as much as possible.   What is ""post-transaction data"", and why does Accenture need/want an exclusive  license on aggregate data?  Also regarding the exclusive license, we need  to consider all necessary exceptions to the exclusivity, such as Enron s  internal use, transmission to the customer, etc.  Also, all transmissions  of customer-specific data require the customer s prior consent; the exclusivity  should apply only if that consent is  obtained by Accenture, and only for  as long as that consent is valid.      6.    One key aspect of an exclusive license is how it is  terminated.  Normally there are increasing minimum royalties associated  with the licensee s continued exclusive rights.  Often the licensee has the  right not to pay the minimum royalties, in which case the license can convert to  a non-exclusive or the license can terminate.      7.    In Section 2.1(a), there is a reference to Accenture s  right to sublicense.  This right needs to be carefully narrowed and clearly  stated.  Can Accenture remarket the data to anyone other than the  customer?      8.    The term ""Customer"" is confusing.  In Section 2.1(b),  it would seem to relate only to EnronOnline customers, but later in that section  it speaks of ""its [Accenture s] customers.  In the definition schedule, the  term is not limited to EnronOnline s customers.      9.    In Section 2.2, the same comments in points 5 apply to the  exclusive license of the software.      10.    There is a reference in Section 2.2 to ""updates and  revisions.""  Will Enron be responsible for these?  What continuing  services will Enron be obligated to offer for the software?  Will Enron be  entitled to receive and use any improvements or updates that Accenture may make  to the software?      11.    Should the scope of the license be limited  geographically?  Why is it worldwide?  If it is worldwide, what  happens if Accenture does not market in some countries?  Is Enron excluded  from using or licensing the data in those countries?      12.    In Section 2.3, I assume that Enron will dictate the  format of the data to be received, and that Enron may revised that format from  time to time.      13.    Section 2.3(a) has some language that says that Enron will  provide... the interface between Accenture and Enron?... and ""any other software  developed by or on behalf of Enron necessary for Accenture to perform its  obligations to its Customers?  That is ridiculously broad.  What  obligations to Accenture s customers?  I can t imagine that Enron would  give Accenture additional software for ""free"", especially if Enron spent  considerable amounts developing it.  Additional software may require  additional license fees, etc.      14.    The concept of service levels and service level  credits (in Section 2.3) is typical in service agreements.  I wonder what  Accenture has in mind.  They certainly resist any meaningful service levels  or credits when they are providing service.      15.    Section 2.4 is truly amazing.  It is so broad that  Accenture could argue that anything Enron does adversely affects Accenture and  that Enron has to pay Accenture...  If Enron is willing to provide  Accenture with a non-compete in addition to the exclusive license, then these  provisions need to be harmonized and carefully limited.  Perhaps Accenture  thought that this provision was for the benefit of Enron, in that it enables  Enron to complete potentially competitive transactions without violating the  exclusivity license (although in my view the language of the license doesn t  really reach this point).  We need to discuss the business points that  Accenture is trying to address in this section and start again with the  drafting.        16.    Section 2.5 is yet another twist  on exclusivity.  This also needs to be tied into the scope of the  exclusivity provisions.  If an Enron Customer hates Accenture and refuses  to do business with them, then what happens?  Can Enron provide the service  to that customer?  If so, what is the effect of the exclusive right in  Section 2.5?      17.    Section 2.5 also contains a reference to ""co-branding  marketing"" activities, and requires Enron to support and assist Accenture.   This is much too broad.  Enron may or may not wish to engage in  ""co-branding marketing"" activities, and if so they need to be narrowly defined  at the time.      18.    The exception in Section 2.5 to Enron s provision of the  data services is very troubling, as it would appear that Accenture is trying to  limit Enron s discretion in establishing its own pricing.  If Accenture  really wants this type of protection, we need to review it with antitrust  counsel.      19.    The payment terms seem extraordinarily generous for  Accenture.  It would be highly unusual in my experience to have license  fees paid only once per year.      20.    Not that I would know, but the minimum payments seem very  low to me.  The minimum payments is the best way to establish whether  Accenture has met its obligations to market, etc., so that it can keep its  exclusive rights.  I would think that the minimum fees would be  significantly higher.  They could be indexed to the number of transactions,  customers or transaction value of EnronOnline, so that if EnronOnline grew  faster than expected, Accenture would have to keep pace or loose its  exclusivity.      21.    The use of ""Gross TSH Revenues"" as part of the formula for  royalties is typical, but it presents a very significant challenge because  Accenture will have other relationships with its customers and may under price  this service (e.g., as a loss leader), and try to make their money on consulting  services.    It would be better for Enron if we could come up  with a transaction fee, that Accenture would have to pay Enron for each  transaction/transmission of data to a customer (indexed appropriately), and then  let Accenture worry about how it makes money.      22.    We need to consider the tax issues further.  I think  that the fees paid to Enron for data transmission/resale and for the software  may be subject to state sales tax.  Accenture should be responsible for at  least the taxes related to the data transmission/resale.  If it is  reselling these services to its customers, it can provide Enron with a resale  exemption certificate.  The license of software is probably not subject to  the same exemption and may be taxable in any event.  That would require us  to split the revenue stream between the two types of services (data and  software), or run the risk that the whole stream is taxable regardless of the  resale certificate.  We need to consider these issues further with tax  counsel.      23.    [I ll skip commenting on the IP provisions of Article IV  for now.  Suffice it to say that they need work.  But we need to work  out the business deal before worrying too much about these provisions.  But  they will be critical to our agreement with Accenture.]      24.    The Term is another amazing provision.  First, five  years is a very long time in my view to have an exclusive license for this type  of new/evolving business.  Second, Accenture s proposal for a  unilateral option to extend it for five more years is a bold move.  But it  seems ridiculous to me that the minimum annual payments for those additional  years (of exclusive rights, I assume), would be fixed at $1 million.   Surely they jest.      25.    Enron needs a way to terminate this license early, either  through a buy-out right or a termination for convenience with a payment.   Also, if Accenture is violating the terms of the license or otherwise violating  ""material"" terms of this Agreement (which we may have to identify), Enron should  have the right to terminate.  I have often used the approach that the  licensor should not be permitted to terminate except in the event of a payment  default, but we should seek much more.  Especially if Enron only gets paid  once a year.      26.    I noticed that Accenture did not offer any  representations.  Some would be appropriate.      27.    The liability/indemnity section is interesting in that it  lacks any indemnity by Accenture to Enron s benefit.  I would think that  Accenture would indemnify Enron for all claims by customers relating to  Accenture s service (e.g., mapping errors, translation errors, etc.), except if  directly related to Enron s error.  We need to discuss this risk  model.  We have to assume that EnronOnline s customers would come after  both Accenture and EnronOnline, and we need to consider how these claims should  be handled.      28.    The limits of liability are interesting.  I wonder  what the story is behind the $25 million limit for us, and the $5 million limit  for them.      29.    We would not accept the exclusions to the consequential  damages as drafted; and we would want to exclude claims related to Accenture s  breach of Enron s IP rights from any consequential damage limitation.   [That will get their attention.]      30.    The ""worldwide license"" provisions of Section 9.1 require  some discussion.  I doubt that Enron intends to get consents for and make  all filings in countries where Accenture wants to sell these  services.     See  you on Monday at 9:30am.

Jesus CondensateFYI -----Original Message-----From: 	Graham, Charlie  Sent:	Tuesday, June 19, 2001 2:42 PMTo:	Delaine Kurth (E-mail)Subject:	Mt. Jesus CondensateDelaine,The Operating Agreement between Northern and KN (now Oneok) entitles Oneok to all condensate and drip liquids removed from any of the Northern pipelines, equipment or facilities upstream of Oneok s Bushton Plant.  That agreement also provides that Oneok will be responsible for picking-up, hauling and providing a detailed accounting of such liquids removed.  In addition Oneok is to pay Northern for the shrinkage attributable to such condensate and drip.  Northern invoices Oneok monthly for a cash reimbursement of the mmbtu s attributable to the condensate removed.Effective April 2000, Oneok began short paying its invoices.  The table below summarizes the amount shorted through April 2001 as $67, 889.36.  This short payment reflects Oneok s refusal to reimburse Northern for removal of condensate attributable to the Mount Jesus Drip, lease # 71176.  Oneok has indicated to Northern that Oneok s contract hauler contends the liquid removed from Northern s system at this point is water.  In spite of evidence provided by Northern to the contrary, Oneok accepts its contractor s contention, apparently pays a disposal fee, and refuses to reimburse Northern for the mmbtu s lost.  This location produced condensate prior to the March 31, 1997 agreement and no change to Northern s pipeline operations that would impact condensation dropout has occurred.  Oneok was properly reimbursing Northern prior to April 2000.  In addition, the attached analysis of liquid removed from the location on September 20, 2000, demonstrates that hydrocarbon condensate continues to be collected at the drip.  Northern must insist that compensation for these BTU s removed from Northern s System be made by Oneok.  Your immediate attention to this matter is appreciated.ThanksCharlie(402) 398-7061Northern Natural Gas Company											Shortpay Analysis											Mt.

"Ken and Jeff:Glen Darden, the President and CEO of Quicksilver Resources, Inc., is a longtime personal and professional friend of mine.  Recently, he has asked whether I would consider serving as an outside Director on the Board of Directors of Quicksilver.  Before meeting with Glen to discuss this further, I want to make sure that Enron does not have any objections.Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, Quicksilver is a natural gas and crude oil production company engaged in the development and acquisition of long-lived producing natural gas and oil properties. Quicksilver began trading publicly in March of 1999 on the American Stock Exchange (KWK).  Quicksilver has a long standing business relationship with Enron.  Enron has historically entered into pre-pays and hedging transactions related to natural gas production and continues to do so today.  Enron (via JEDI) also provided some financing at the time of the merger of Quicksilver and Mercury Exploration and was a significant shareholder of Quicksilver at the time of its initial public offering.  I believe JEDI has since divested this stockholding.If I were to serve on the board of Quicksilver, I expect that there will be related party transactions of a routine ongoing nature that would need to be disclosed and which I would need to abstain from voting on as a member of the board.  However, I do not feel there would be any material conflicts of interest as Quicksilver s core business is complementary to Enron, not competitive with Enron.  As a personal matter, it is an experience that would be beneficial and would provide valuable personal visibility in our industry.I am scheduled to meet with Glen and others at Quicksilver later this month to further discuss this possibility.  Would each of you please let me know after due consideration whether you have any objection to or concern with the position.  Please do not hesitate to call me (x67713) if you have any questions or wish to discuss this further.Thanks.Jim Hughes",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False

(This article was originally published Monday) NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- New England consumer advocates Monday said federal energy regulators overstepped their jurisdiction in ordering the consolidation of the wholesale electricity markets and transmission systems in the northeast U.S. The Federal Energy Commission in mid-July directed operators of the power grids in New York, New England and the Mid-Atlantic to merge, as part of a sweeping series of orders designed to put control of the country s transmission system in independent hands. Federal law allows the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to require transmission systems to connect, but only at the request of a state regulators, according to a filing made by Maine law firm on behalf of consumer groups, nonprofit energy groups and the attorney general of Massachusetts. ""The Commission makes no claim in the New England Order that it is acting at the behest of a state commission or public utility, and is, therefore, without authority to mandate the involuntary combination of the Northeastern RTOs,"" the groups said in their filing, which asked FERC to reconsider its consolidation decision. FERC should give the three Northeast grid operators a transition period to evolve into three regional transmission organization, or RTOs, with similar market designs, transmission tariffs and governance structures before requiring them to merge, the filing said. The commission directed the operators of the wholesale power grid in New England, New York and the Mid-Atlantic to meet with utilities, generators, trade groups, state regulators and a FERC judge in Washington for 45 days beginning July 19 to outline plans for creating one transmission organization from Washington, D.C., to Maine. The regulators also directed Judge Peter Young to submit recommendation to them 10 days after the conclusion of the talks. The commission ordered the consolidation of the Northeast power grid ""at breakneck speed"" without studying the technical feasibility of creating one RTO and without analyzing the costs and benefits of merging, the consumer groups said in their filing. Young has directed meeting participants not to discuss the substance of the negotiations, but sources familiar with the talks said the group is outlining a business model describing how to structure a Northeast RTO without filling in the details. Participants have said, for example, that this regional market should have one transmission tariff and one interconnection standard, but haven t defined what that tariff and standard should be. ""Many people are very discouraged by the ongoing talks,"" said Anthony Buxton, an attorney with the Maine law firm that submitted Monday s filing. All 300 meeting participants have been gathering in Washington twice a week and have been working on the issues every day outside of those meetings, Young said. Next week, they will break off into smaller groups and begin meeting every day, according to Young and market participants. The commission was in turmoil when it issued its RTO decision, as evidenced by Chairman Curt Hebert s resignation last week, and should therefore reconsider its order, Buxton said. The consumer groups also asked the commission to allow residential electricity users to have a say in how the unified electricity market in the northeast U.S. will run. Market participants, including consumers, will have an advisory capacity only in this new market and won t be allowed to vote on the rules that govern the market, as they do now, Buxton said. This decision contradicted another one FERC issued in 1996 requiring utilities to open their transmission lines to competitors. In that order, the commission encouraged New England to create an independent system operator to oversee the power grid and to give market participants equal say in determining how this regional transmission system and electricity market would operate The consumer groups that filed Monday are working to galvanize other organizations representing residential customers in New England, Buxton said. ""Consumers are going to be at the forefront of a massive attack on FERC for what it s done,"" Buxton said. -By Kristen McNamara, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2061; kristen.mcna <mailto:kristen.mcnamara@dowjones.com>713-853-9287 888-703-0309",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False

"Greetings from the land of watery-eyed, flat-assed office workers! How goes the burly mountain man thing? I ve been hearing second hand from Elliot that you re faring extremely well mentally despite some poorly crafted sleeping bags and a bad case of frostbite on your toes. (That second part I made up, but it sounded appropriate given the sleeping bag situation.) All s well here. As you could imagine, and probably often do, the sweeping expanse of people staring at computers that is Enron has changed not at all since you left. There are still many computers, many of them have changed positions, some have gone away, most we are not sad to see go. That s just the nature of this cutthroat business. Also on the stagnantly invariable list is the status of my life in relation to Enron. I am still here. I still stare at the computer. Every once in awhile I meander over to the dark window-less corner that enshrouds the IT wizards and ask them silly questions like, ""What does it mean when I hit this button and my screen starts flashing at me like a disco ball, then makes this awkward shrieking noise and finally goes black?"" They are incredibly helpful. I am still pretty much clueless about most things, although I ve learned to talk about them with a semblance of authority, as in, ""No, you twit, the 25 megawatt off peak deal should clearly be flowing across SP-15 to NP-15 because of the illiquidity of SP s market right now. What kind of idiot wouldn t hedge their position in California at a time like this?"" It all sounds very exotic and important to me, which is why I m still here. But I m infinitely jealous of your wild exploits in the great American outdoors. I suspect my forbearance for sitting in an office will run out right around the middle of the summer, so I m planning a trip to coincide with that meltdown. I haven t decided between a road trip through the western United States or just a direct flight to Paris. Both sound good, and way beyond my budget, therefore equally attractive. Well, I ve managed to say practically nothing for long enough now. I do hope you re having an amazing time, rambling on toward the next crazy adventure on the horizon as I believe Jack Kerouac once wrote. We re all very proud of you here and constantly refer to you as ""my good friend Winston who s skiing across the state of Wyoming, which was my idea."" I d love to hear about your trip direct from the source, although I know you re extremely busy out there, skiing and killing wild animals for sustenance and whatnot.

"Good Morning! Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month. For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston s low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow.

"Energy Firms  Mixed Message Is Focus of Inquiry Deregulation: Senate panel will investigate whether suppliers were being misleading when they promised lower rates for consumers while they were also predicting bigger profits for investors. By ROBERT J. LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers In the summer of 1999, a top official with a major player in California s power market testified during a congressional committee hearing in support of speeding up deregulation. Unleashing market forces, said the Dynegy Inc. executive, would ensure ""maximum customer savings"" and ""low-cost power."" That same month, the Houston-based firm made a far different pitch to Wall Street: Deregulation and major swings in electricity prices would boost revenue and stock value. ""We know how to take advantage of volatility spikes across the gas and power market,"" Chief Executive Officer Charles Watson declared in a publication targeting large investors. ""The energy marketplace,"" he predicted, ""will simply get more volatile."" Dynegy was not alone, a review of federal filings, company documents and public records shows. In the years since California s pioneering deregulation plan was approved, other major out-of-state energy suppliers were sending similar, seemingly contradictory signals to the public and stock buyers.Now, those divergent messages--electricity prices will fall but corporate revenue and profits will climb--will be a key focus of a special state Senate committee charged with investigating the alleged manipulation in the power market.""How you can tell your investors you re about to make a whole ton of money in the very short term, and tell the consumers of California you re about to get lower rates?"" said Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), a former consumer attorney who is heading the legislative probe. Investigations by the state attorney general and federal regulators are continuing, but remain largely secret.The Senate panel could offer the most open and wide-ranging examination yet of alleged misconduct among power sellers. The bipartisan panel expects to begin requesting documents from power producers as early as today and begin hearings in a few weeks. Committee members stress that they are hoping the power companies will cooperate but are ready to issue subpoenas if necessary.Suppliers Deny Misleading PublicThe legislative probe comes as many state officials are moving aggressively to expose alleged market manipulation and overcharges totaling billions of dollars by the power suppliers.""Somewhere along the line, there may be a skunk in the woodpile. And if there is, we need to find out about it,"" said K. Maurice Johannessen (R-Redding), the committee s ranking Republican.Another panel member, Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), noted that all companies try to maximize profits. ""But [we want] to understand how the market was manipulated and how sellers took advantage of the market.""The power traders strongly deny acting improperly or sending misleading signals to the public.""Hogwash,"" said Tom Williams, spokesman for North Carolina-based Duke Energy. Spokesmen for Dynegy said there was nothing inconsistent in the statements of their executives.The companies maintain that California s problems stem from soaring electricity demand, lagging power plant construction and a faulty deregulation plan adopted by the Legislature in 1996. ""You have a flawed structure there,"" said Dynegy spokesman John Sousa.Sousa and executives of other power suppliers say their comments to the general public and to Wall Street are not contradictory because unfettered competition--not the California model--would have created opportunities to both make money and cut rates.Still, regulators, lawmakers and ratepayer groups note that only half the promises made by the power dealers have been realized so far--their earnings and stock prices have risen at record rates as electricity prices have soared.""The big lie was, while they were telling ratepayers to  Trust us, we re going to lower your rates,  they were planning the entire time to raise the rates,"" said San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre, a former federal prosecutor who specialized in fraud cases. Aguirre is representing state ratepayers in a class-action lawsuit against the power companies.Just last month, California s independent grid operator reported that many power sellers ""used well-planned strategies to ensure maximum possible prices."" Potential overcharges could total nearly $6.3 billion. The Senate panel wants to track information that Dynegy and other generators were providing to the investment community in the 1990s as a possible way of determining whether they entered the California market with plans to run up electricity costs. Among many other things, the committee plans to seek internal projections of how the firms expected wholesale prices and profits to rise under deregulation. Members also want to know how the suppliers expected to recoup billions in outlays for California power plants being unloaded by regulated utilities. Some of the purchases were far above book value, stunning analysts.""What did they know that the rest of us didn t at the time they were purchasing those generations facilities?"" asked Dunn. ""They knew something.""One thing the power wholesalers say they did know was that tight power supplies in California would probably boost prices, at least for a time.""They were going anywhere where they thought energy [use] would spike upward,"" recalled market analyst Joan Goodman, who was familiar with company pitches. ""California was one of those places because it didn t have sufficient [power] plants.""Duke Energy projected that prices would rise after 2000, although the company says it did not foresee the huge increases that occurred, according to spokesman Williams.However, when the company sealed one of the first packages of power plant purchases in the state in 1997, Chief Executive Officer Richard Priory said in a press release it would ""deliver greater value"" to California customers.The publicity spin was similar when Edison s sprawling beachfront power plant in El Segundo changed hands the following year. ""Consumers in California will begin to benefit from more competitively priced electricity and more vibrant economy,"" announced Craig Mataczynski, vice president of Minneapolis-based NRG Corp., a partner in the purchase with Dynegy.Big Growth Was PredictedUtilities reaping profits from plant sales also trumpeted the consumer windfall theme. Electricity rates would drop 20% by 2001, Pacific Gas & Electric s top executive, Robert Glynn, said in early 1998. ""There is no product bought on a daily basis that has such a predictable downward price trajectory into the future.""But to its Wall Street audience, the power suppliers emphasized climbing revenues.Atlanta-based Southern Co., now Mirant, told investors in 1999 that its plan to buy plants and market power had brought the company to the ""doorstep of significant growth opportunities.""""We believe our strategies will result in the best shareholder return available,"" Bill Dahlberg, then-chief executive officer, said shortly after buying three California plants.Mirant spokeswoman Jamie Stephenson said assurances given the public and assumptions directed to Wall Street were ""just a different way of delivering the same message."" The firm was saying it would be ""reliable to shareholders and reliable to consumers.""Now, with rolling blackouts and record electricity bill increases, federal and state authorities are alleging that large energy suppliers played the power market too hard.Last month, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said it found evidence of $124 million in ""unjust and unreasonable"" charges during the severest periods of electricity shortage. The commission, often criticized for being too lenient on private power companies, ordered the firms to refund the money or further justify the charges.Some firms are contesting the findings, saying the prices they charged were justified. Investigators and regulators have faced a vexing challenge trying to unravel the complex financial workings of the large power traders. The companies closely guard information, and some recently refused to comply with subpoenas from the state Public Utilities Commission, which is also probing the power market.Whether the Senate investigating committee will have the resources and tenacity to get much further remains to be seen. But Democrats and Republicans alike insist they are serious about untangling how the power market went haywire.""I haven t seen that much smoke where there hasn t been a fire,"" Dunn said.

"Paul, I am glad you sent me this message. It will help to clarify a few issues. 1. I was contacted by Christian (this means I did not start this phase of the process)    last Friday, as far as I can remember.     Christian expressed interest in joining the Research Group. I told him two things:       a. We would be delighted to have him here.       b. Our mutual relationship and good practices require that he receives           your blessing before we can move ahead.    We agreed to have a conference call Wed morning, your time, with you, Christian and    Mike Roberts.   2. Wednesday call was subsequently cancelled by Christian. Mike and I decided to call you      anyway Thu morning your time, directly, to discuss the matter. I was in a PRC all afternoon and       asked Mike to call you  in case I could not sneak out to join him. Mike called and was      told you were out sick.  3. I am leaving in a few hours for California. I shall be driving back to Houston for the next     3 days. Please, feel free to call Mike an discuss this matter with  him in my absence.  4. I think Christian has a strong preference to be in the Research Group, assuming he moves to     Houston. I think he came to this conclusion after visiting Houston in early July. I did not      bring up the issue of transfer with him at all when he was here.      I can  understand his motivation and think we should take his preferences into account. But the     first  issue is if he can leave Sydney at all. I hope it helps. Cheers.

We are now negotiating for a freeze on the net cash (through Jan 7) pending a presentation by Enron and CSFB (next week) as to why it is in the estate s best interest to allow EW to operate as a going concern in order to maximize value to the estate on sale of the business.

Christian properly responded that the whole idea would be contingent on finding and training a replacement meteorologist for the Sydney office and getting your buy-in that the move would be good for Mother Enron in totality.It was only with that understanding that any conversations along those lines proceeded.  Christian showed me the modelling progress he had made (Vince was out of town for this and thus unaware of it), but, quite frankly, I was very impressed with his achievements. I can see how he has become a valuable asset to your efforts.The way we left the matter when Christian returned to Australia was that he would propose the subject to you for any further action.Then, before I even had an opportunity to update Vince upon his return on my discussions with Christian, Christian called Vince to get his ideas on the subject (My hours aren t as conducive to Houston-Sydney phone link-ups, but Vince is here late into the night).   Vince s first and immediate reaction to the idea was to set up a telephone conference with you before even proceeding with the concept.That is what somehow triggered the misunderstanding, but while at the same time, clarified what was happening and alerted you to the situation.

"Good Morning!Bottom line: No Changes.For the near term (1-5), we see some cool anomalies arriving into the Dakotas by Monday already, with highs in the Dakotas in the mid-30s and lows in the mid-teens.By Tuesday, Texas and the Midwest will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston s low in the mid-40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight.  Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely.

"Good Morning! Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month. For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston s low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow. So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation s gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter.

This Program is one of his most successful and important contributions to Enron, and will continue as a cornerstone of the Company.  It remains our single most important source of new talent.The purpose of this memo is to reassure you that the direction, philosophy, and importance of the Program remains unchanged.  As we have said many times, most of our new businesses were created by graduates and members of the Program.  Many of the current leaders of our company are also graduates of the Program.Three broad principles will continue to guide the direction of the Program.?	We will have only one Associate/Analyst Program at Enron, and it is a Company asset.?	We will have a ""One Enron"" presence on campus to provide clarity of message and purpose.?	The Program is rotational in nature, and will prepare our future leaders for success by providing exposure to Enron s network of people and systems.The business prospects for Enron, and the opportunities for personal growth and development have never been better.  We also enjoy the deepest and broadest talent pool we have ever had.

I just thought I d tell you my thoughts of the Houston people - I worked with most for 4 years.  I know you probably know most of them.Nigel Patterson- basically trained me - he is the NYMEX trader- worked for BT almost 13 years in London, NY, and Houston .  Andy Zipper trained him.  He s a good trader - traded currencies, commods (metals, energy).  He could trade any of our products- would be especially good at new businesses.  He has been in Houston for 4 years and is originally from New Zealand- has a wife and 2 girls.  Vice President.Calvin Schlenker- ran Calgary office for 2 years before we shut it in 1997- he then took on head of marketing role in Houston - his successes have been with producers - being able to exploit lending and hedging.  Most recently, he s been trading the nat gas options book.  Very smart guy with good ideas- analytical and conceptual- he d be VERY good with Per s syndication efforts or credit derivative initiative.  Knows gas and crude.  He is Canadian- ex-wife and 2 kids.  Director.Steve Provenzano - basis trader - very good contacts in the industry.  Worked for MG before BT. He did a lot of marketing with me.  Because he s done both trading and marketing, he s got a good edge with customers.  Only has gas experience.  He is likely to go to New York but recently got married and has a kid on the way.  Director.Also, Deutsche s two head oil traders in London just quit- but I am not sure what they are doing yet- will find out.  That is Janelle Matharoo and Jason Thiel (MD and Director)- both been with BT almost 15 years- very good traders- always in London.  Jason used to be BT s head gold trader: Janelle has also traded metals.Looks like Deutsche is crumbling on energy- I know they have added a few crude traders in NY to service their hedge fund clients (our prospective clients) but they have not been able to pull everything together- they are loosing all the key people in the business.I d like to help in the process of pulling some of these people in if we have the desire.Kind Regards,Caroline",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False

"Good Morning!Bottom line: No Changes.For the near term (1-5), we see some cool anomalies arriving into the Dakotas by Monday already, with highs in the Dakotas in the mid-30s and lows in the mid-teens.By Tuesday, Texas and the Midwest will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston s low in the mid-40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight.  Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely.  Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation into the...6-10 Day time period, which will see a cool shot over the Midwest/East towards next weekend, moderating again by early the following week. Then, early in the...11-15 Day time period, more cool air moves in, beginning with central cooling, then even into the Southeast.So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation s gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter.

"Kevin--	As we discussed yesterday, Panda Energy International, Inc. and TECO Energy, Inc.

The partnership may be called ""Panda Gila River L.P.""Here are some of the details as we know them:	All building/ air permits received, construction has commenced	Financing closed 6/04/01 (oversubscribed by 56%)	$2.2 bn loan ($1.7bn 5 yr. bullet loan and $500mm equity bridge)	Financing led by Citibank and Societe Generale	50% of power output sold under long term contracts, 50% on spot marketWhat we want to know is:	How did the banks get comfortable on the financing if only 25% of the gas pipeline transport capacity is under contract? (And right now there is only one pipeline capable of serving the plant s needs)How did the banks get comfortable with only 50% of the power output sold under long term contracts?What happens after the bullet loan comes due-- are the operators taking interest rate risk and hoping to refinance at a lower rate in year 5?Any information you can provide on the above would be very helpful.

"A few thoughts before the NG meeting --1.	Maybe we should (as a team) call Transelect (Paul Buckman) before our NG meeting.  You may remember that Transelect sent an initial letter into Skilling to try and solicit our support for stopping the NG application to be managing member of the ARTO.  I think that it would be good to call Buckman and ask if he has a better idea than NG.  We are right now stuck between two very bad answers - let AEP and FE construct a managing member or have NG.  Maybe Transelect has a better solution.2.	Chief Issues with NG --a.	are they ""really"" independent?  having a short position in NY and owning generation in NE effectively makes NG into a ""market participant"" - I think that Enron should make as a hold firm position that to operate an RTO there can be no agreement with anything less than almost perfect independence.b.	who do they feel the customer is?  maybe we want to get Paul Dawson s take on their business model from the UK.  it is critical that the new RTO operators across the country view traders/marketers and generators as their key customers.  what form of regulation for cost recovery of their operating expenses do they want - pass thru, PBR, etc.? c.	who writes the tariff?  I would make a strong argument that the problem with most of the RTO work to date has been that FERC has allowed the current incumbents to first write a bad tariff and then assign the provision of service under that tariff to someone who has very little (if any) control over future changes.  the RTO operator must be free to make changes to the tariff with only two constraints - (1) must not restrict the ability to pay facility revenue reqts and (2) must not damage the assets.  d.	do they intend to build/own transmission and how does this impact the energy markets?  will their planning and construction processes impact any long term positions that EPMI may take in the energy market.  how do they manage to allow other merchant transmission into the business?e.	how do they intend to provide balancing energy?  the flip side of our fight on congestion management involves the pricing of energy imbalances.  what is NG intending to do on this issue?  does NG believe that multiple control areas makes sense for a single RTO?  does NG support unbalanced/uncovered schedules day-ahead?

"First choice: New Years if Bill & Amanda can get the first week of 2001 off. Second choice: Another time (I guess in 2001) when everybody can be there.Third choice: The week of Thanksgiving.I guess I would prefer not to go for a long weekend because it takes me so long to get there, although the Thanksgiving weekend is pretty long & might work if nothing else does.	""Linda Hayman"" <LHAYMAN@skadden.com>	09/06/2000 05:29 PM		 		 To: Mark.Taylor@enron.com		 cc: 		 Subject: Re: SailingI sent an e-mail to Amanda to sound out her views.  My guess is that she will want to go several times.  Her usual response to a choice is to avoid it.Since lots of things might work, do you have any preferences/choices.  Are you committed to an entire week?  Want to shorten it to a long weekend (or is the travel to much of a pain for you).I don t think there is any plan that will include Bill in 2000.  If we include Amanda, I think it is either Nov 3-8 or it is Thanksgiving.  We could do a long weekend on either of those dates or if you want to take the whole week off, you and I could go for the week and Amanda could join us for part of it.  I don t know how much time you want to spend on this venture.  Do you want to wait until 2001?  Give me some idea what is your first, second, third choice.  And of course you can choose more than one ( I am sure Amanda will).Linda HaymanSkadden, Arps,Slate, Meagher & Flom, LLP4 Times Square, 42nd FloorNew York, NY  10036T:  212-735-2637F:  917-777-2637>>> <Mark.Taylor@enron.com> 09/05/00 09:22PM >>>Wow - too many choices.  Let s see, the day of the week charters start andend is not fixed - except that the boat has to be available on the days youwant it.  We usually went Sunday to Sunday so we could get 2 weekends inand use the Saturday as a day to fly down.  It s much harder to get therefrom Houston than NYC (fewer flights) so it pretty much takes all day toget there.  The 3rd - 8th is a Friday through  Wed. - not optimal from theweekend point of view but doable I suppose  - it just means a 4 day insteadof 7 day charter.  If you want to wait until Thanksgiving we couldcertainly manage with the 2 of us - particularly if we got one of thesmaller boats - and it might make sense to go back to the BVI where we knowthe sailing won t be all that challenging (I hear the St. Martin area canget rougher).  Plan B sounds like fun too - and then we could all gotogether later (it seems mean to go without Bill) - New Years sounds like ablast to me!  What would you think about heading down the Friday orSaturday before (12/29 or 30) and spending the first week of January there?That assumes Bill can get that week off and Amanda doesn t have to be backin school til later.  I have a couple of sailing friends here that mightlike to go then too if you re interested in a slightly larger  group.They re a lot of fun, good cooks and reasonable sailors  too!

Is that something the three of us can work with?Alternatively, do you think the two of us could manage over Thanksgiving -with amanda joining for the long weekend (fly down Thurs eve and back Mon).I can t remember what day of the week charters begin and end. - is it setin stone?   Plan B - we could met at the Greenbriar or DC for Thanksgiving.I understand from Amanda that Bill is not going anywhere until 2001.  Ofcourse that does make New Year s eve a possibility.  If all else fails, Idid hear from Greg this week and he wants to know if we are still sailing.And I am still looking for something to do over Christmas.Linda HaymanSkadden, Arps,Slate, Meagher & Flom, LLP4 Times Square, 42nd FloorNew York, NY  10036T:  212-735-2637F:  917-777-2637>>> ""Mark Taylor"" <Mark.Taylor@enron.com> 09/05/00 06:36PM >>>I sent Amanda & Bill an e-mail a couple of weeks ago and here is Bill sreply.I sent him a fairly detailed note on how we usually schedule things andwhichwere the best times of year, etc.  I haven t heard anything from Amanda andwasbeginning to assume they were not really interested in a November trip.Haveyou heard anything firm from Virginia?  Bill s next-to-last paragraph tellsmethat he s getting to know Amanda - but I don t think she ll leave him aloneforthe holiday.  The real question is whether her uncanny ability will extendtohis schedule, too.

I have also confirmed with Frank and Amita Gosalia the situation with regards to responsibilities for Japan when processing PAs.  Japan has always been the responsibility of the Houston PCG except in the case of metals customers which are approved by credit and legal in London.It would seem that this is an issue that needs to be discussed further between the London, Houston and Australia groups to establish responsibilites further.

They claim that this conflicts with an indemnity clause in the agreement for non-performance which allows for recovery of attorneys fees.2. They want to delete  subsection (e) of the submission to jurisdiction clause which contains a waiver of the right to claim immunity from suit, execution, attachment or other legal process.Can we give on these points?

National Fuel transferred 1,000,000 dth from our parking contract to our brand new firm storage contract.  We are now long FSS and short PALS. FSS We have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 33,333 dth per day.  However, we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 33,333 dth on any given day.  Also, the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect, like Trco-Leidy.  We do not have to ship the gas on Nat Fuel.  IASWe give Nat Fuel the gas back on an IT basis via our IAS agreement (Nat Fuel is still setting up the contracts).  We can give Nat Fuel the gas back at any point we wish.  We do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we withdraw on the FSS.  And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it.COSTWhat we will probably do most of the time is take the FSS into Trco at Leidy and payback the IAS agreement at Niagara and Leidy.  ENA will pay Nat Fuel 1,000,000 dth x ($.125 / 3 months) or $41,666.67 per month for June, July, and August.  This deal is over on Aug 31st.  I just entered the demand charge on my Market East demand charge sheet.  I do not have any deals set up in Sitara.  I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first.  I will keep track of the balances on an Excel worksheet.  All commodity cost and fuel is capured in the $.125 demand charge.  Beavy and I will make sure the payback and withdrawal tickets are balanced in Sitara once we start flowing gas on this deal.  If we payback 60,000 dth next week and we do not have any withdrawals, then I will show a 60,000 dth withdrawal on 8/31/2000 just to keep the tickets balanced.Payback TechniquesUnder the expert eye of the wonderfull, superfantastic, all-around great guy, Dick Jenkins, I ve come up with some options on paying back the gas.Niagara - only works when Niagara is open.  Nat Fuel has been very close to capacity this week.  However, we should always see what Martin can do with the gas if it gets backed up into TCPL.  OR if Niagara is constrained, we can ship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel, at today s prices that cost about $.105Wadd - take our Tenn Z6 length into CNG via Iroq, ship it to Trco- Leidy, and payback the gas at Leidy.  At today s prices, that cost about  $.055, assuming we get to roll over all of our CNG fuel waivers.Tenn -   we just need to see what type of IT rate Dan can get to ship the Gulf to Tenn Z4 (Ellisburgh).  We can also move the Dracutt to Nat Fuel on segmented capacity for $.145 or  move Wright to Nat Fuel for $.11.  We cannot use the Net 284 contract on any of the Tenn / Nat Fuel interconnects.Let me know if you have any questons.",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False

Media General wants the cross-default to be reciprocal at $100 millionfor both Media General and Enron.2.   Further, Media General thinks that this should be a cross-acceleration,not a cross-default.3.   Page 3 of Schedule.  The ""date by which to be delivered"" for Party Bshould track the same with Party A: i.e., if financials are available onEDGAR then they would not be automatically provided by MG on a quarterlybasis.4.  Page 4 of Schedule.  Under (a), add ""Attn.: Chief Financial Officer"".We will send Marshall Morton s fax and telephone numbers.5.  We will let you know who will serve as process agent.  We would like totalk about governing law in Texas and the site of arbitration in Houston.6.  Page 6 of Schedule.  In clause(b)(g), please note that MG intends toassign this agreement and we want to make sure that does not affect thisrepresentation.7.Page 8 of Schedule.  MG wants the right to assign this agreement to aparty with a credit agreement equivalent to a certain level.  We can discusswhat that level should be.  We should discuss what Enron s credit rating isin this connection.Transaction Confirmation Document.1. MG does not think this transaction should be characterized as a""swaption"".  This was to be a deal for the purchase of newsprint at a fixedprice, not at Enron s option.2. We want todiscuss the expiration date. We should also discuss the otherdates and terms which are blank.  On page 2, under ""Additional Provisions"",the date for satisfying conditions is clearly wrong since it refers to July5.  Once again, all of this ties in with not being an option, but a fixedagreement.3. We would like to have Enron render a monthly settlement statement with anet amount being paidto/receivable from MG.  No netting is presentlyprovided for in the agreement.ISDA Credit Support AnnexMG  would like to delete this entirely and would propose that Enron wouldrely on the general cross-acceleration provisions.  Media General nevercontemplated credit provisions more onerous than its credit agreements.          I will have the Media General business people follow up with thepeople at Enron, but could you please have some one get in touch with me onthis.Thanks,John",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False

"Good Morning!Bottom line: No Changes.For the near term (1-5), we see some cool anomalies arriving into the Dakotas by Monday already, with highs in the Dakotas in the mid-30s and lows in the mid-teens.By Tuesday, Texas and the Midwest will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston s low in the mid-40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight.  Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely.  Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation into the...6-10 Day time period, which will see a cool shot over the Midwest/East towards next weekend, moderating again by early the following week. Then, early in the...11-15 Day time period, more cool air moves in, beginning with central cooling, then even into the Southeast.So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation s gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter.

This section (i) should read: ""If a Security pays a dividend or makes another distribution, the payment to be made by the Seller shall be equal to the gross amount of the cash dividend or distribution per share (excluding for the avoidance of doubt any tax credits), as the case may be, multiplied by the Dividend Percentage, multiplied by the Contract Quantity"".We should include a definition for ""Dividend Payment Date"" to read, ""The Equity Payment Date relating to the Valuation Date (s) on which the relevant Dividend Period ends"". We should also include a definition for ""Dividend Amount"". The ""Dividend Amount"" definition should read, ""100% of all ordinary cash dividends where; (i) the ex-dividend date occurs during the period from the day following the Trade Date to and including the final Valuation Date and (ii) the date on which the related ordinary cash dividend would have been received by persons who held the Shares comprising the Basket during such period is during the relevent Dividend Period"".I believe we should address Section 5.2 ""Potential Adjustment Event"". We should recommend replacing the language similar to the Intra-Period Adjustment language we utilitized in the Enron Credit Confirmation. Their section allows CSFB to ""determine"" the provisions of the Intra-Period Adjustments. CSFB should not have control over determining any additonal payment or adjustment of the Opening Price or Contract Quantity. The Intra-Period adjustment language is comprehensive in covering all provisions therein.4) Schedule to Basket Swaps:	a) Applicable Interest Rate Cycle: should read ""1 month""	b) Termination Date: should read ""1 year""	c) Business Day Convention: should be the standard ISDA ""Modified Following Business Day Convention"" language.5) We should also include the Annex structure to be able to monitor the positions held, along with any subsequent adjustments, in the Equity Swap Basket at any time throughout the deal.Please advise if you like to meet to discuss the documentation in further detail.Regards,Jorge A.

(""EPMI""), Enron Energy Services Inc. (""EES""), Enron EnergyMarketing Corporation (""EEMC""), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. (EESO)and Portland General Electric Corporation (""Portland General"")(collectivelysometimes referred to as the ""Enron Entities"")Harvey, Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued bythe California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter ""the Commission"").The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking itsinvestigation into the problems in the California electric markets byproducing a limited quantity of specified information on a timely basis.  Webelieve that the limited production we propose will enable the Commission tocommence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced tolitigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production,which are, by any standard, extremely broad and could involve millions ofpages of documents.  We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchangeof October 3, 2000 with the understanding that the Commission agrees that bycooperating, offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entitieshave not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoeverand that any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise orother responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in thefuture, if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documentsthat are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney workproduct privileges. [SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION:  Generally speaking, the documents andinformation that the Commission seeks can be found, if they exist, withinEPMI, EES and Portland General.  To the extent that EEMC or EESO arerelevant to the Commission s investigation, any documents would be locatedwithin EES.  Thus, we do not anticipate specific document productions fromeither EEMC or EESO.]GENERAL DOCUMENTSRequests 1 through 4 The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations havingacquired, sold, divested, joint ventured, spun off and otherwise reorganizedthemselves extensively during the past two years.  The burden and expense onEnron to locate, and produce every corporate organizational chart anywherein its organization since April 1, 1998 is significant.   The Enron entitieswill provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizationalcharts, telephone directories and so called ""family trees"" to show itscurrent organization.  To the extent that Enron can readily identify andlocate exemplars of significant organizational charts, telephone directoriesor so called ""family trees"" for earlier periods it will also make thoseavailable.  One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on itscorporate history.  If a list of those books would be helpful, we canprovide it.  With respect to the other entities, to the extent thatcorporate histories can be found, they will be produced.  We anticipateproducing these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000.Requests 5 and 6 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 willidentify their relationship to affiliated companies and the TransactionDocuments will identify its customers and suppliers.FINANCIAL DOCUMENTSRequests 7 through 11 The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the periodrequested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, EES, and Portland Generalwill provide to the Commission electronic Transaction Documents for thepurchase and sale of energy delivered which includes economic data.   It isintended that this economic data will provide the Commission with financialinformation regarding the Enron Entities which will be useful to itsinvestigation.   We anticipate producing public filings regarding financialdata on October 13, 2000 and the electronic Transaction Documents in thesecond wave of document productions.GENERATING DOCUMENTSRequests 12, 14 and 18 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generationfacilities are limited in number and there will probably be limiteddocuments available.  The Enron Entities to the extent they act as ascheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generationoutput, do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generationunit requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General, do havedocuments and information for Enron Wind, Saguaro and Las VegasCogeneration.  We propose to produce these documents in the second wave ofdocument productions.  For Portland General, the production of the requested documentswould involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General ownedtwenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about onehalf of its total energy demand.  As a result, we question whether theeffort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on theCalifornia wholesale market is necessarily limited.  In addition, thosetransactions which do involve Portland General sales into California arelimited to sales to the ISO and PX, and long term contracts with two smallCalifornia municipal utilities.  Thus, the Commission will receive theessential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO andPX.  Nevertheless, Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data beingprovided by other Enron Entities, to the extent relevant.  [We propose thatthe Commission defer requesting production of other information until it hasreviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion oftheir energy into the California market.  At that time a more accurateassessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuablegiven the limited impact of Portland General generation on the Californiawholesale market.][Alternate ending to paragraph:   We propose for the voluminous PortlandGeneral generating cost and maintenance data, that these documents be madeavailable in Portland for inspection from a representative sampling offacilities.  If there are specific documents that the Commission would likecopied from that production, we can discuss the arrangements for producingthese documents.  We propose to make these documents available in Portlandin a third wave of document productions]TRANSACTION DOCUMENTSRequests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19 We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data forthe purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of transaction datafor year 2000 (in California and outside of California and Real Time) forthe purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date, counterparty,quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is a purchase or asale.   Because of the speed with which you want this information, it ispossible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate.  For thosetransactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, weunderstand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there willnot be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI scustomer on an accounting system rather than as part of the tradingbusiness.  EES is a retail provider of electricity, and plays a far morelimited role in the wholesale markets which are the subject of theCommission investigation.  However, EES can also provide similar electronicTransaction Data with the proviso that it will not include the specificnames of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customernumber.  This additional restriction is important to EES because many ofEES s customers have agreements whereby they must be notified of anysubpoena and provided an opportunity to object.  EES cannot meet your timeframe to release information and give its customers the notice they require.Given that EES was a retail provider and the fact that the identity ofretail customers is of little or no relevance to the functioning of thewholesale market, we do not believe protecting the identity of retailcustomers is an unreasonable limitation or narrowing of the request.  Weanticipate producing the transaction data in the second wave of documentproductions.FERC DOCUMENTSRequest 20 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they receivedfrom FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies ofthose responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,2000. Based upon discussions that we have had with the various EnronEntities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions onFriday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities couldmake that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available forproduction by then. We propose to make these productions with the understanding that ifany entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currentlyin place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will beprotected by the most stringent protective order.  In addition, if, at therequest of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or acourt of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production belimited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right tolimit the production of documents in conformance with such order. We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us knowif they are acceptable to the Commission.

However the fact remains that fundamentals have changed little in the past month with the same supply issues which served to tighten this mkt over the last eight weeks continuing to keep a firm hold on the market throughout Q4 and Q1 2001. Indeed with the ocean frt market still steeply inverted for the winter versusthe rest of the year ( $11 versus $9.50 RBCT/ARA) and with the U.S mkt experiencing a massive squeeze front end (east coasttrading $35 fob barge) there is little sign of relief in the short term - Q1 2001 Fob ARA is now trading close to $44 with Jan/Dec2001 around $43.25. Producers will of course lead us to believe that the origin markets are structured in a steep contango forthe remainder of the year, however leaving the issue of mkt consolidation aside there is little in the mkt to justify this - if anythingdemand in the Far East looks a little shakier with steel orders slowing down and the financial markets under pressure and forecastsfor European demand estimate unchanged demand year on year. While a marked sell off for second half of the year is unlikely wesee the forward curve on the fob origin side flat going forward rather than contango. This said we cannot preclude a shift higherof absolute prices for the whole curve from where we are today at around $33 Fob South Africa equivalent to $35 - there is stillplenty of business to be done for 2001 and my feeling is that consumers will end up buying into it rather than risk the wait andsee game - we cannot underestimate the influence on international prices that the cartel hold and even if this is exaggeratedit s implication is enuff to create a bullish psychology.SPOT TRADES 150,000mt of Pinang quality from KPC for Dec shipment at $27.60 Fob Indo basis 6000 kcal/kg160,000mt of Prima  quality from KPC for Nov shipment at $30.15 Fob Indo basis 6400 kcal/kg150,000mt option of Prima quality from KPC - to be shipped latest end June at $30.65 Fob Indo basis 6400 kcal/kg.2 x 150,000mt Put Options from TXU for April/Sep and Oct/Mar 02 respectively.

Cleopatra Dream arriving in Rotterdam on Nov 26 with 143mmt of Australian coal to sell intothe mkt.EOLMuch of the talk at Coaltrans centred around the press release from GlobalCoal of the intention of the Cartel plus Rio to launch an e-platform which will provide mkts against 3 Fob origin points and an ARA delivery point. Details of operational functionalityare scarce and increasingly it looks like this is explained by fact that they themselves do not know but general consensus reckonsit will be operational end of first quarter 01. Rather than see this as competition, if successful it could provide us with more accessto markets than we have previously had and there shud be some fun and games to be had with the various producers.  Total volumes for EOL to date are at 1,700,000mt. We have seen a lot of interest in our options which in not surprising given current mkt conditions as consumers look to hedge themselves with cheap out of the money options. As volatility increases other non-traditional coal players are also entering the mkt to utilise the opportunities which increasingly volatility presents. Next project is to get quotes in Euros andafter that we will begin to look at spark spreads via EOL.GAMEPLANWe had a major cuppla weeks on the buying side prior to Coaltrans - 75% of which is owned through optionality out of RBCT at between$30 and $31.50. Additional avenues into South Africa through Maputo and Durban now means that we have a decent portfolio of SouthAfrican material to add to our Colombian long. Overall our position is some 2.5 million mt long including the latest Indonesian purchases -our efforts now are focused on securing some of the term business which is out there at current numbers - it is difficult to call this mktin either direction with any certainty and hence we are busy covering any downside potential with a host of put options which the utilitiesare keen to mkt in this bullish enviroment. After weeks of writing that we need to add other origins to our long portfolio we look in far bettershape today with good prospects to add further flexibility in terms of diversity of origins which ultimately reduces our reliance on Drummond.While the mkt in general is still seemingly unable to grasp the true value of an option we will continue to exploit this chink by owning asmuch flexibility as possible thru physical put and call options.Best RegardsJez",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False

A win at the DC Circuit and, subsequently with FERC, would possibly mean some upside for Enron -- even if for one year pre-new RTOs (per Kevin $10-15 MM).  There is also something positive about being on the same side as a utility against another utility.We should approach VEPCO about talking with some FERC people about possibly settlement:  it may lead to something positive and can allow us to discuss our RTO agenda and why RTOs (with our congestion management) solves this.  Thus, we think there is upside to continuing.  Let us know!  Thanks.-----Original Message-----From: Steffes, James D.

FERC appeal at DC federal court (Entergy source andsink)The mediator in our appeal of the Entergy source and sink suggested that Enron may want to try and settle this.  I asked B&P for the costs to get through oral argument, which are only $4000.  During the course of our SE RTO mediation, the Entergy person working on congestion management agreed with me that implementation of the LMP/financial rights model in the SE would alleviate the need for the Entergy Attachment M and Southern s similar attachment.  However, that model (should we get it) won t be in effect until sometime next year (at the earliest).  Also, Enron has sold its control areas. (VEPCO, our co-appellant, still has Batesville in Entergy).It seems that it would make sense for us to approach FERC staff working on this matter, get their thoughts, and then perhaps approach Entergy.  FERC is the one that would actually settle, not Entergy (also, FERC must change the policy -- getting Entergy to simply withdraw Att. M is certainly good for precedent, but Southern can still keep its Att. unless FERC makes Southern change its tariff).  If nothing else, having another FERC avenue to voice our support for the LMP financial rights model (no day ahead balanced schedules), which alleviates this discriminatory practice like Entergy Att. M, would be helpful.

Since arbitration is the final stage in the dispute resolution process agreed by the parties and it has been agreed that there should be continuity until any dispute is finally resolved, this position should properly apply to each stage of the dispute resolution process. I suggest that since the dispute resolution procedure envisages continuity, until resolution, that Consumers should continue to invoice on the basis that they have done for the last few years. Richard, we will need your input as to whether we could argue the above with a sufficient degree of confidence to persuade a judge to make an order of specific performance as against Consumers to invoice using the basis that they have been using for the last few years, pending outcome of the dispute resolution process. Further, whether you believe that we will be entitled to seek such equitable relief. We need to take control of this process and ensure that Consumers are always playing catch-up, if we fail to do so we will be playing catch-up and will be out of pocket until the conclusion of the arbitration process. If we do not get Consumers to invoice and pay the sums we believe are due, there will be no incentive on Consumers to start the process and every opportunity for them to delay any resolution of this dispute. I have spoken with Sandy Hollingsworth who will be sending me copies of documents that Dynegy have uncovered which she believes further assist our case. Once I receive them we ought to meet to review and obtain a better understanding of the case we are able to make and the case which may be made against us.

I agree that most of the bills don t ""get it right"" - the hope is that the FERC can do that without too much legislative guidance (which of course would be wrong).

Even if Enron is a ""hot button""these days, we remain big fans of yours.In regard to your comments on the letter, I disagree with some of theassertions.First, I am fairly confident that no major piece of energy legislationwill be passed this year.  As you can see from the attachedcongressional update for the DE Task Force prepared by Bev Jones (formerVP for Consolidated Natural Gas), Jimmy Hayes (former Member ofCongress, and Nancy Etkin (former head of Natural Gas VehicleCoalition), there is every indication that legislation is going to getbottled up in the Senate.  I agree with the assessment.Moreover, the legislation that is being considered has almost nothing init of direct relevance to ""getting it right"" in regard to restructuring.Without pressure, I expect no federal leadership on restructuringissues.  While I do agree that commissions are usually a stallingtactic, both Ken and I are dismayed at the lack of focus, resources(i.e., DOE has devoted almost nothing of any sort to restructuring) andlack of qualified personnel directed at promoting more competition inthe energy market.  While you and I may have some idea of what isnecessary (and that is a stretch for me -- given the complexity of thechallenges), I can safely say the vast majority of folks have no ideawhat to do -- especially about the tricky jurisdictional questionsinvolved.I personally think one way to craft a ""new federalism"" on restructuringis to bribe the states into more action.  The federal government doesthis with education, housing, etc.  Why not with restructuring?  Acarrot for those states which are moving forward, linked to definitemetrics of progress and openness.I also strongly believed that state PUCS and federal agencies like FERCare being pushed to the limit about what they can accomplish givendeclining budgets and personnel.  I further think that this slows thewhole process down.  Think about it -- telephone deregulation, a growingcrisis in regard to water, record levels of mergers and acquisitions,historic changes in regard to natural gas and electric regulation -- allpiled on top of each other for these folks.Good catch on the numbering of the recommendations cited in the letter.This has been corrected.I look forward to seeing you in September at the Board meeting.JamieP.S.   Speaking of the DE Task Force, have you and Bob Frank made adecision yet to participate?  I hope you do, but I need to know as soonas possible.-----Original Message-----From: Steffes, James D.

While I amalways supportive of more public statements pushing competition, neitherI nor Enron can sign on to the letter.First, I am concerned that having Enron sign on will distract from yourmessages.  Enron is a ""hot button"" in DC and will change the properfocus.In addition, I would argue that the recommendation for a nationalcommission is out of place with the current timing of FERC andCongressional action -- which is imminent -- while a commission woulddelay action on the Hill and at FERC, thus supporting the forces againstcompetition.  Let s not study this too much - we know what to do.  Moveaway from the commission.Also, I m not sure how providing federal grant money only to states thatpromote competition supports our efforts.  Making GA pay for PA is adistraction from the main fights at FERC and on the Hill.Finally, I would guess that more funds to FERC and other agencies willonly be used to increase enforcement against those in the industry.While Enron wants markets that work well, the core problem is that wehaven t deregulated enough - not that markets aren t working.Also, I don t know where the recommendation numbers from the Bush/Cheneyplan came from -- I think it was an earlier document -- there are nosuch numbers in the final printed version of the report that I have.If you want to talk, please let me know.Thanks,Jim**********************************************************************This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliateand may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use ofthe intended recipient (s).

Gray Davis  (D) tentative agreement to buy Southern California Edison s (SCE) transmission assets will face tough scrutiny from suspicious lawmakers who do not believe it is in the best interest of ratepayers. State regulators are also expressing concern about the deal and consumer advocates are predicting its demise.""There are two alternatives,"" says the Bowen source. ""Lawmakers will either fashion a better deal or allow SCE to work out their problems in bankruptcy court."" Bowen is the chair of the Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee.The deal calls for SCE to sell its transmission assets to the state Department of Water Resources (DWR) for 2.3 times its book value or $2.76 billion. The agreement also calls for the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to establish a rate plan so that $3.5 billion of debt could be recovered by SCE for its power purchases before the state began buying electricity in January. ""This is the single most important cash flow provision of the memorandum of understanding,"" says a source with the state Office of Ratepayer Advocate (ORA). ""SCE will collect all of the costs they have incurred."" ORA had argued against bailing SCE out of debt saying its parent company had ample funds.In return for the premium paid in excess of the value of its transmission assets, SCE has agreed to sell the output of its generating plants at cost-based rates.""Because of the premium, cost-based rates should be lower,"" says the ORA source.""The senator is very skeptical,"" says the Bowen source. ""The deal is a great benefit for generators and utilities but little, if any, benefit for ratepayers.""The source says there is also concern with the SCE deal because it will only involve about a third of the 32,000 miles of transmission lines in the state.""If you buy a third of a bridge don t you wind up getting wet"" asks the Bowen source. Davis has expressed optimism that the state will eventually obtain all of the state s utility transmission lines. Pacific Gas & Electric s (PG&E) bankruptcy filing has complicated the governor s plan, but Davis says the state can now obtain the assets through the courts. However, the state must now compete with private companies intent on the same thing. Negotiations between the state and San Diego Gas & Electric are continuing.The Bowen source says provisions in the deal which fashion a way for generators to collect all they are owed by SCE is also of concern to lawmakers.""The state s position was that the rates charged by generators were unjust and unreasonable,"" says the source. ""If you now pay the generators you have, at the very least, a public relations problem.""The source says there may also be a court fight over the issue.""The creditors dealing with PG&E in bankruptcy court would probably want the same treatment,"" says the source. ""This creates an intriguing whipsaw effect.""A bill outlining the terms of the agreement between the state must be introduced before official consideration begins in the legislature. A source with UCAN says a bill based on the present agreement will never be passed.""If it survives, it will be modified,"" says the source.

"Good Morning! Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month. For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston s low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow. So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation s gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter.

As I hadsuggested, they understand what the reference to the 188 MW encompasses.Also, there would be no problem with substituting different generator setsfor the LM 6000s if there is an economy/efficiency basis for it andreliability is not impaired.He went on to say that he saw no problem with the CPCN Application from anengineering perspective.  As far as the engineers are concerned, NorthCarolina Power needs the power and they are pleased that the generation isgoing to be built in North Carolina.  He expects the bulk of the questionsregarding the project to come from the Accounting Division, and most ofthose will be directed to North Carolina Power and to be focused on the RFPprocess.The Public Staff has three divisions that investigate and analyzeapplications--Engineering, Accounting and Economic Research.

"There would seem to me to be two questions--the threshold one is whether thesite is within Rocky Mount s service territory.  If it is, then whatobligation does NCNG have with respect to the construction of a deliverypoint.  I haven t reviewed the annexation statutes yet, but based on myinitial reading of the Service Area Territory Agreement between Rocky Mountand NCNG, once annexed the site would come within Rocky Mount s purview toserve, and, although a ""mutually agreeable"" delivery point would have to benegotiated, NCNG would at least have to negotiate that in good faith.The January 13, 1992 Service Area Territory Agreement gives Rocky Mount theright to distribute natural gas within the city s incorporated limits aswell as a specified area outside the incorporated limits.   The contractgoes on to provide that should any part of that perimeter be annexed intothe city, ""the respective rights of the parties as to service in any suchportion shall be determined by applicable case law and the General Statutesof North Carolina. . .""  The contract further provides that absent an orderof the NCUC to the contrary, NCNG agrees that Rocky Mount has the right toserve all end users within the ""aforementioned"" area--presumably referringto the annexed area, although the agreement is not a model of clarity.So, at least based on this language, Rocky Mount s right to serve arguablytracks its incorporated limits, whatever they might be.  (Jonathan and I arelooking at annexation law to see what else might be lurking out there).The 1992 Service agreement provides, In Article IV, provides that points ofdevliery for all natural gas purchased or transported under the agreementwith NCNG shall be ""at the following locations and other stations added atmutually agreeable locations in the future. . ."" In the Third Amendment tothe Natural Gas Service Agreement, dated March 10, 1997, new language anddelivery points are negotiated upon, but the principle is still includedthat  other stations may be added at ""mutually agreeable locations in thefuture.""

I think he was confortable with the factthat the CPCN will be reviewed by electrical engineers who understand thegenerators described without the elaboration he thought necessary.One of the problems with amending the application is that you run the riskthat the Commission will adjust the time frames for intervention, etc.,accordingly.

If it is, then whatobligation does NCNG have with respect to the construction of a deliverypoint.  I haven t reviewed the annexation statutes yet, but based on myinitial reading of the Service Area Territory Agreement between Rocky Mountand NCNG, once annexed the site would come within Rocky Mount s purview toserve, and, although a ""mutually agreeable"" delivery point would have to benegotiated, NCNG would at least have to negotiate that in good faith.The January 13, 1992 Service Area Territory Agreement gives Rocky Mount theright to distribute natural gas within the city s incorporated limits aswell as a specified area outside the incorporated limits.   The contractgoes on to provide that should any part of that perimeter be annexed intothe city, ""the respective rights of the parties as to service in any suchportion shall be determined by applicable case law and the General Statutesof North Carolina. . .""  The contract further provides that absent an orderof the NCUC to the contrary, NCNG agrees that Rocky Mount has the right toserve all end users within the ""aforementioned"" area--presumably referringto the annexed area, although the agreement is not a model of clarity.So, at least based on this language, Rocky Mount s right to serve arguablytracks its incorporated limits, whatever they might be.  (Jonathan and Iarelooking at annexation law to see what else might be lurking out there).The 1992 Service agreement provides, In Article IV, provides that points ofdevliery for all natural gas purchased or transported under the agreementwith NCNG shall be ""at the following locations and other stations added atmutually agreeable locations in the future. . ."" In the Third Amendment tothe Natural Gas Service Agreement, dated March 10, 1997, new language anddelivery points are negotiated upon, but the principle is still includedthat  other stations may be added at ""mutually agreeable locations in thefuture.""  The question which then arises is what Rocky Mount would have togive in exchange.

PG&E admits that they transferred accumulated credit balances off of the residential accounts BEFORE they calculated the final direct access bill.  The final bills were all debit amounts due to the rate increases and the new procured energy credit calculations.  PG&E then transferred these debit balances on to the customers  first utility bill.  We found out this had happened when we received calls from angry customers who had received disconnect notices.  They had been told by PG&E that Enron had refused to pay the final bills.

If it is, then whatobligation does NCNG have with respect to the construction of a deliverypoint.  I haven t reviewed the annexation statutes yet, but based on myinitial reading of the Service Area Territory Agreement between Rocky Mountand NCNG, once annexed the site would come within Rocky Mount s purview toserve, and, although a ""mutually agreeable"" delivery point would have to benegotiated, NCNG would at least have to negotiate that in good faith.  The January 13, 1992 Service Area Territory Agreement gives Rocky Mount theright to distribute natural gas within the city s incorporated limits aswell as a specified area outside the incorporated limits.   The contractgoes on to provide that should any part of that perimeter be annexed intothe city, ""the respective rights of the parties as to service in any suchportion shall be determined by applicable case law and the General Statutesof North Carolina. . .""  The contract further provides that absent an orderof the NCUC to the contrary, NCNG agrees that Rocky Mount has the right toserve all end users within the ""aforementioned"" area--presumably referringto the annexed area, although the agreement is not a model of clarity.So, at least based on this language, Rocky Mount s right to serve arguablytracks its incorporated limits, whatever they might be.  (Jonathan and I arelooking at annexation law to see what else might be lurking out there).  The 1992 Service agreement provides, In Article IV, provides that points ofdevliery for all natural gas purchased or transported under the agreementwith NCNG shall be ""at the following locations and other stations added atmutually agreeable locations in the future. . ."" In the Third Amendment tothe Natural Gas Service Agreement, dated March 10, 1997, new language anddelivery points are negotiated upon, but the principle is still includedthat  other stations may be added at ""mutually agreeable locations in thefuture.""  The question which then arises is what Rocky Mount would have togive in exchange.  In the 1997 agreement, Rocky Mount agreed to an extentionof terms of the of ten years, until December 6,",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False

London has undertaken this with respect to Europe (and, shortly, Singapore).  I have undertaken to coordinate this with respect to North America.  Thus, if you could send me a list of North American Enron entities to be incorporated in the E-commerce program (and the products they will trade) I can then undertake to determine what issues such presents.  In this regard, I will coordinate with ECT-Legal in North America to verify that the manner such entities are to be incorporated into the E-commerce program does not trigger unplanned for tax consequences.In addition, it would be helpful to obtain copies of the form of agreements to be entered into by counterparties prior to such parties being granted access to the E-commerce system (i.e., the form of on-line access agreements and any agreements ancilliary thereto).  These agreements are important to the tax analysis of the E-commerce program because the manner such agreements are to be entered into may implicate tax nexus concerns that we will want to work to mitigate (for example, if it is contemplated that all such on-line agreements are to be administratively executed by a single entity (""Administrative Entity"") on behalf of each Enron trading entity participating in the E-commerce system, such process could expose the Enron trading entity to tax exposure in the jurisdiction in which the Administrative Entity is located - obviously, this may be more complicated if it is uncertain where such Administrative Entity is located).Finally, it is understood that the manner in which trading is to be effected through the E-commerce system is such that the Enron trading entity established as the entity to trade with a particular counterparty will be the only such Enron entity transacting business with such counterparty.  In this regard, therefore, it is not contemplated that one Enron trading entity will transact in part with a counterparty and that another Enron trading entity will complete such trade (for example, it will not be possible for a counterparty to obtain an agreement with respect to a particular product with EEL that will then be supplied by ECT - though this may occur on occasion in a fashion no different that is currently the case).  Please notify me in the event that this understanding is not correct so that we can plan to mitigate the potential tax issues that will be raised if trading is to occur otherwise (in this regard, as was discussed on Tuesday with Dave Mally and David Port, if a trade is transacted in a manner whereby one Enron entity executes a transaction and fulfills the requirements of such by purchasing inventory from another Enron entity, the income derived in such transaction is potentially subject to taxation in multiple tax jurisdictions).Please contact either myself at x30938 or, if I am unavailable, Jeff Blumenthal at x35777 in Houston with any follow-up questions.

Nothingfancy or time consuming, just a brief updateFor example:Today:          (1) The court in California (a) ruled that Natwest does not have todisclose tapes of conversations with Cravath in October of 1998, even aboutMarch 1998 disclosures, and even though Natwest is asserting an advice ofcounsel defense with respect to the March disclosures and (b) deferred rulingwhether Natwest must disclose conversations with Cravath in March 1998concerning disclosure issues relating to the C Tranche.  (I want to find outwhat this is about; maybe Enron would be interested in such information.)          (2)  Defendants had a conference call to discuss an effort byNatwest to postpone the trial in California until September.  I don t thinkNatwest has much chance to succeed, but they are going ahead.  I am notplanning for  ECT Securities to take a position.

I encourage each of youto attend, as this will be a very informative and worthwhile seminar.  Mark, along with other noted researchers at the University of Washington, Colorado State University, andthe ECWMF in Redding, are beginining to unravel some of the vagaries of the NAO/AO and to develop thenecessary tools to predict wintertime temperature and precipitation weeks ahead of time. I have askedMark to start from scratch and spend some time on fairly rudimentary concepts pertaining to the NAO/AOand Sudden Stratoshperic Warmings.  He then will build up to his research and discuss where he thinks short-term progress can be made in terms of skillful wintertime temperature and precipitation predictions. Although many of you sat in on my NAO presentation from early this year, I can guarantee you that attending his talk will be worth your while. Mark s main focus will be to elaborate on what diagnostic tools and modeling schemes can be used to anticipate certain extreme phases of the NAO/AO and the likelihood of Sudden Stratospheric Warmings. These can, in turn, be used to something about the probability of cold air outbreaks or heavy snow episodes over parts of North America and perhaps parts of the world (for example).In the end, Joe and I plan to take Mark to lunch to discuss a possible research collaboration between him/ECWMF and ENRON.

Jurisdictional Issues	The ARES Coalition, Alliant, and IIEC argued that the Commissionshould address energy imbalances in the proceeding.  Enron and NewEnergyabandoned this argument after reaching a settlement agreement with Edison.Staff and Edison argued that charges for energy imbalances are properlyaddressed within Edison s OATT and subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC.	The Commission concluded that in the interest of avoiding protractedlitigation and the harm of delay to retail competition, the Commission wouldnot address the propriety of FERC s asserted authority over energy imbalanceissues.  The Commission indicated that its deferral to the FERC in no way""waives its right to assert jurisdiction over energy imbalance service atsome future time.""		2.	Factual & Policy Issues	Edison proposed an energy imbalance service to retail customerscontaining the following provisions:*	Energy imbalance will be calculated separately for each hour andsettlements will occur on a cash basis for each hour s imbalances;*	For those RESs whose energy imbalance in an hour is 2% or less, or 2MW or less, settlement is made at 100% of out-of-pocket costs (""OPC""),regardless of the net imbalance or the direction of the error;**	Those RESs whose energy imbalances exceed 25% of their ownindividual schedules will pay an adder or be charged a discount of 25% ofOPC.  Adjustments are made to avoid double-counting of adders and discountsapplicable to those RESs that are also subject to an adder or discountbelow.  These imbalance charges will be phased-in as follows:**	From October 1, 1999 through December 31, 1999 -- No adder  willapply under this provision.**	From January 1, 2000 through March 31, 2000 -- 25% adder/discountwill apply to those RESs whose imbalances exceed 25% of their schedules 20%or more of the hours of the month.  If the 20% of the hours are exceeded,the adder/discount shall apply to all hours.**	Starting April 1, 2000 -- 25% adder/discount will apply to thoseRESs whose imbalances exceed 25% of their schedules 10% or more of the hoursof the month.  If the 10% of the hours are exceeded, the adder/discountshall apply to all hours.*	Edison also applies a bandwidth to the total net energy imbalanceattributable to unbundled retail load served by RESs.  If the hourlyimbalance caused by all unbundled retail load, excluding PPO load, is withinthe 100 MW bandwidth, no RES (except those whose imbalance exceeds ?25%, asnoted below) will be subject to an adder or discount.  PPO load will, inaggregate, be subject to the same terms and conditions as above, butimbalance attributable to the PPO will be compared against a 100 MW deadbandseparately from all RES load.*	Edison will permit RESs to trade energy imbalances among themselves,to offset their imbalances at whatever prices and terms they wish, beforeapplying a charge for energy imbalance.  According to Edison, this featurewill allow RESs to minimize energy imbalance charges by exchangingoverscheduled megawatt-hours for underscheduled megawatt-hours in the samehour.  All remaining imbalances will be settled in cash at 100% of Edison sOPC.  Edison shall make available information on OPC ten days prior to theopening of the trading window.**	The net retail energy imbalance in excess of 100 MW will be chargedan adder or discount of 10%.  This charge will be allocated among RESs whoare out of balance in the direction of the net and whose imbalance exceedstheir individual deadband.  The allocation will be based on the ratio-shareof the amount by which these individual RESs  imbalances exceed theirindividual deadbands.  Any such adder/discount will be billed separatelyfrom charges for any imbalances remaining after trading. Likewise, anyadder/discount attributable to the provisions of Paragraph 3 will be billedseparately from charges for any imbalances remaining after trading.**	Load profiles will be developed using Dynamic Load Modeling withseasonal adjustments.  Edison will not require the installation of intervaldemand recorders for customers of less than 400 kW at this time.**	Energy imbalances will be assumed to be within the bandwidth (i.e.,no adders/discounts) when the imbalances are due to (1) Edison interruptionsand restorations, or (2) customer force majeure events, that are in eachcase material to the RESs  schedule and of which the RES could notreasonably be aware in sufficient time to adjust the schedule.**	Edison will include a description of the methodology for determiningOPC in its energy imbalance schedules filed with the FERC.	The IIEC opposed Edison s proposal and requested that the Commissionrequire Edison to offer an optional imbalance service at the distributionlevel.  Blackhawk also opposed Edison s proposal and supported the IIECproposal  Alliant also supported Edison being required to offer an energyimbalance service at the distribution level.  Mid-American opposed anyeffort by the Commission to exert jurisdiction on energy imbalances.	The Commission failed to weigh-in on the energy imbalance issueconsistent with its determination that the FERC is the appropriate forum forsuch issues.  The Commission reserved the right to address the issue in somefuture FERC proceeding.____________________________________________________________________________The information contained in this communication may be confidential, isintended only for the use of the recipient named above, and may be legallyprivileged.

Hopefully this message willreach you with no problems.I hope this message finds you both very well!  As you may recall, I will beworking for McKinsey and Company in Seattle starting this fall.  However, myinterest in energy has continued to grow since Wharton s Tiger Team projectwith Enron last spring, and I decided to spend the second half of my summerworking in the industry.I am currently serving as interim Marketing Manager for e-Acumen, a venture-backed provider of high-end analytics, software, and advisory services tofinancial services companies trading weather derivatives and re-insurersdealing in catastrophic weather risk policies, as well as to power and energyindustry clients.  Our primary investor is GE Power Systems, while some of ourother investors include Woodside Fund, Perseus Capital, CreateLabs, andNewVista Capital.I represent the Weather Risk Services group, which provides consensus weatherforecasts--forecasts that consistently beat the National Weather ServiceMedium Range Forecast model--to financial, power and energy industry clients,of which Enron is one. In addition, the group provides load forecasts to manyof the largest power traders in the country.e-Acumen s newest product, WeatherAcumen, is a quantitative weather riskplatform based on leading edge portfolio optimization analytics and simulationtechniques.  WeatherAcumen mitigates weather risk by more accuratelydetermining intrinsic values of weather derivatives, and features proprietaryapplications of a non-parametric Monte Carlo simulation engine that provideshigh fidelity indications of statistical arbitrage opportunities, resulting inmore profitable hedging and trading strategies.A WeatherAcumen demonstration is scheduled for September 14 with Mark Tawney,head of the weather desk, as well as Claudio Ribeiro, Joe Hrgovcic, andMichael Nguyen.   While they will be considering the functional benefits ofsuch a platform to Enron s weather operations, I wanted to discuss a longer-term partnership opportunity with you that could benefit Enron from amarketing and profitability standpoint.One possible model for collaboration could involve e-Acumen providing a directlink from the WeatherAcumen platform to EnronOnline in order to driveincreased trading volume to your site.  WeatherAcumen s superior analytics,industry-leading weather backcasts and forecasts, and proprietary simulationtechnology allow weather derivatives, power, and gas traders to have greaterprice-discovery capabilities.  Even better, firms trading with a WeatherAcumen-enabled counterparty will have more confidence in posted prices, and thus bemore willing to trade on your site.  We feel that such a partnership couldvery beneficial to both Enron and e-Acumen.I would appreciate the opportunity to talk with you in person. Please let meknow if there is a convenient time to call you to discuss how we mightcollaborate with Enron.  Thank you very much, and I look forward to thepossibility of working with you again.Very best regards,Heather ThorneMarketing Manager, e-Acumen",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False

"Ken and Jeff:Glen Darden, the President and CEO of Quicksilver Resources, Inc., is a longtime personal and professional friend of mine.  Recently, he has asked whether I would consider serving as an outside Director on the Board of Directors of Quicksilver.  Before meeting with Glen to discuss this further, I want to make sure that Enron does not have any objections.Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, Quicksilver is a natural gas and crude oil production company engaged in the development and acquisition of long-lived producing natural gas and oil properties. Quicksilver began trading publicly in March of 1999 on the American Stock Exchange (KWK).  Quicksilver has a long standing business relationship with Enron.  Enron has historically entered into pre-pays and hedging transactions related to natural gas production and continues to do so today.  Enron (via JEDI) also provided some financing at the time of the merger of Quicksilver and Mercury Exploration and was a significant shareholder of Quicksilver at the time of its initial public offering.  I believe JEDI has since divested this stockholding.If I were to serve on the board of Quicksilver, I expect that there will be related party transactions of a routine ongoing nature that would need to be disclosed and which I would need to abstain from voting on as a member of the board.  However, I do not feel there would be any material conflicts of interest as Quicksilver s core business is complementary to Enron, not competitive with Enron.  As a personal matter, it is an experience that would be beneficial and would provide valuable personal visibility in our industry.I am scheduled to meet with Glen and others at Quicksilver later this month to further discuss this possibility.  Would each of you please let me know after due consideration whether you have any objection to or concern with the position.  Please do not hesitate to call me (x67713) if you have any questions or wish to discuss this further.Thanks.Jim Hughes",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False

She will make these and circulate the model later today.  I few items worth mentioning -		1) Capex assumptions still seem too high for 2002-2004.  However, the 2002 number is some $30 million below the ""Dynegy transition"" capex amount shown in the 2002 Capex schedule.  Can we just assume non-discretionary only with the Base Gas repurchase in 2002/2003? Any discretionary would be commercially-driven. [Geaccone, Tracy]  The lower capital is probably from the revised plan.  I am okey with the other assumption. 		2) Keep O&M flat to 2001 numbers? [Geaccone, Tracy]  Costs have been reduced due to Dynegy transition.  If we assume under our control, costs would be the same or slightly lower.  I would propose the same for now. 		3) Tracy / Shelley - Any thoughts on how to incorporate the contract info to better analyze the ""contract roll off"" scenarios? We have just assumed the 2002 Plan with 1-2% growth rate going forward with a new rate case in effect in 2005. Rod, not sure how you want to look at rate case assumptions or expansion opportunities but we can discuss tomorrow.  Recognizing the volume of NNG contract info and the time constraint we are under, there may or may not be any better alternative. [Geaccone, Tracy]    I think this is a good assumption 		4) Rod - we have assumed an equity infusion of $175 million to re-capitalized NNG to more ""reasonable"" levels.  I can reduce the amount to $112,500,000 which is the Citibank prepay amount allocated to NNG if that sounds reasonable. 		5) We will show a reduction in A/R of $1.807 billion and a corresponding reduction in equity due to the MCTJ loan.		Any thoughts you have on the above items would be very helpful.  We are trying to send out the info memo by the end of the week.  This model will be the basis for the NNG valuation.

Because text has been rearranged and several provisions have been substantially reworded, the version of this agreement marked against the prior version is not particularly helpful, but I am happy to provide one if you wish.  Please note that I am the only one on the Enron working group that has seen this revised draft; it therefore remains subject to comments by the other members of the team.  Instead of providing a redline, I thought it would be helpful to review the most substantive changes in this e-mail.  Please feel free to give me a call with any comments or questions.1. As I have discussed with Stephen, you should not assume that we have rejected any of your comments if they did not appear in the attached version.   Please contact me to discuss, or resend, any comments that you believe that we accepted but that are not reflected in this document.2. Several new defined terms have been added.  Several definitions were revised to reflect that eSpeed will be posting prices to a platform operated by a separate legal entity that eSpeed will not necessarily control.3. The defined terms ""Sponsor Material Adverse Effect"", ""Sponsor Regulatory Event"", and ""Sponsor Technological Failure"" have been renamed ""eSpeed ..."" instead of ""Sponsor ...""4. Sections 3(a) and (b) have been slightly reworded to reflect the multiple platform concept.   Section 3(c) was moved from Section 5.  The standards for a party s right to suspend have been revised slightly.  Also, Section 4(d) includes a right by Enron to suspend prices specifically in the event of mapping errors; this provision also relates to the termination right in Section 13 with respect to mapping errors. 5. Section 4 has been rewritten to reflect the multiple platforms.     6. Section 5(b) has been revised to reflect that the parties should develop a set of ground rules for operating and maintaining the Interfaces that will govern the parties once they commence operations.7. Section 6 has not been changed in any significant manner, except for Section 6(d) with respect to commissions8. Section 7 has been moved (it was previously Section 9) and reflects our concerns that the means by which contracts are entered into with Enron are clearly disclosed to Participants.9. The parity section has been revised as we discussed -- essentially, Enron shall use ""commercially reasonable efforts to ensure parity""  10. The reps and warranties and covenants have not been substantively revised, but separate reps, warranties and covenants are made by each party (instead of including both parties reps/warranties/covenants in the same provision).11. Section 12 is new.  We felt that the Agreement did not clearly set forth what would have to be done before the parties could start posting prices.12. We have revised Section 13(a)(i) and (iii) and 13(b)(i) and (iii) (termination events as we discussed); 13(a)(ii) and (b)(ii) are new. 13. Section 14 has been substantially revised, but is still confusing,  However, the idea is that the agreement include a single provision governing confidentiality and that certain information that Enron is particularly sensitive about will be kept confidential, while other information becomes eSpeed s property at some point to do with as it wishes.  Any thoughts about clarifying Section 14 would be appreciated.14. The Indemnity has been revised to include a separate section for each party ((a) and (b)), but we do not believe that the substance of the prior provision was changed.15. We need to give further thought to Section 16 and the provisions that eSpeed provided to us (Sections 15(e), (f) and (g) in the prior draft).  While I have discussed this with Stephen and do not object to the point that those provisions is trying to make, the language is a bit broad in places and we need to spend more time with it to make sure that it does not conflict with other provisions of the Agreement.16. I have tried to reserve the right for the parties to obtain injunctive relief, but this section needs expansion -- and I think Stephen had some specific thoughts about what would not be subject to arbitration.17. The Enron Covenant added as Exhibit H is not perfect, but it is essentially what we had contemplated providing.  The Schedule A listing Specified Products is also attached.  Therefore, the only Exhibit or Schedule missing is Exhibit I, which is the commission structure.

The purpose of the Act is to eliminate unnecessary regulation of commodity futures exchanges and other entities falling within the  coverage of the Commodities Exchange Act (""CEA"") and the provide legal certainty with regard to certain futures and derivatives transactions.  By enacting such changes, Congress intends to promote product innovation and to enhance the competitive position of US financial markets. Certain provisions of the Act open the door for Enron s further product innovation and growth.  Specifically, the Act provides important legal certainty for energy and other transactions occuring both on an over-the-counter (OTC) bilateral basis and on multilateral electronic trading platforms.  Enron was a leading advocate of passage of this legislation.Bilateral TransactionsUnder the Act, bilateral transactions in all commodities (other than agriculture commodities) that do not occur on trading facility (i.e. not on a multi-party exchange) are exempt from most provisions of the CEA as long as the transactions are entered solely between ""eligible contract participants""(i.e. persons and certain legal entities satisfying capital thresholds and other requirements under the Act).  This provision essentially codifies and expands existing CFTC exemptions for swaps and forward contracts, thereby eliminating a degree of legal ambiguity that has frustrated product innovation and growth.  Multilateral TransactionsIn addition, the Act creates a broad exemption for any agreement, contract or transaction in commodities (other than agriculture commodities) so long as they the transactions are between ""eligible commercial participants"", are entered into on a ""principle-to-principle basis"" and that take place on a multi-party ""electronic facility"".  This exemption could facilitate expansion of EnronOnline to allow for multi-party transactions, however certain legal requirements will have to be met.Other TransactionsThe Act also creates a broad exclusion for a number of commodities that are of interest to Enron, including ""credit risk measure"" commodities and weather derivatives .  Again, the derivative transaction exclusion will have to meet certain legal thresholds.This legislation has been over six years in the making and the collective support of many Enron employees has been crucial.  Thank you to all that have contributed to the passage on this important legislation.  We will have a more through legal summary of this legislation in the near future.

"A US/European split is possible, but difficult, especially in terms of our engineering organization which is organized globally, not regionally. For example, much of the engineering support for the Spanish EW 750s comes from the US team; much of the engineering support for the US EW 1.5s comes from Germany; our global blade r&d is in the US; etc.  I would hope that even with a down  02, we can identify buyers which will value the US business based on a medium-term view.

The Democrats would not support any extenders bill as leverage to get a Stimulus Package passed and everything died.  The Speaker has asked the President to call Congress back on Jan 2 to debate the Stimulus Package, but that seems unlikely. The best we can now hope for is that Congress takes up PTC either as part of the Stimulus Package or an Energy Bill in Feb/March  02.  For the wind co, this is good and bad.  The good is that while the Enron BK has kept customers away, at least now none of our competitors can book orders either.  My hope is that PTC extension and the announcement of a new owner for EW will happen about the same time.  The bad news is that it means our US business will be further hurt - a 200 unit  02 is now out of reach and a 100-125 unit year may be the best we can hope for (assuming the PTC is extended in Q1).  (Maybe the Candover folks knew something we didn t, although I doubt it).  For sale purposes, we will run our  02 numbers at 150 units and put as positive a spin on it for bidders as we can.  Bottom line is that  02 will be a break-even to small profit year for us in the US.Stan - we are in the process of revising our financial projections for a teaser to be sent out to bidders next week and this news will be reflected in those projections (meaning that the sale projections will now differ slightly from what we submitted to Enron earlier this week).  Also, we have launched reductions in force in the US.  I will reduce our MFG workforce by around 85 right after the first of the year and expect to have to let another 100-150 go early in Q1.  I will keep you posted.

Thomas and Rangel (the ranking Democrat on Ways and Means) had agreed on a one year extension which is also what the Senate Republicans would agree to.This is partisan politics at its worst.

Interns that came in through this Rice program did not go through the normal campus interviews by the A/A Program.  The A/A Program would recommend that Sheila go through a round of Super Saturday interviews just like all other Analyst off-cycle candidates.  This would allow other top Enron people to review Sheila and evaluate her skill level.  With that said, I believe that Jennifer thinks highly of this individual and the A/A Program could forgo the interviews it you agree to take Sheila in your group for the first rotation.  Please confirm that you would like Sheila to be made an offer from the A/A Program and that you will accept her in one of the EGM groups upon graduation.

Sheila was a summer analysts in the Middle Marketing group. She was part of the Rice Leadership Program. I have served as Sheila s mentor in this program, which seeks to provide business internships for non-business majors. I believe that programs such as this and their candidates are essential to Enron as they provide a pool of academically diverse, bright individuals who can think outside the box.Sheila managed our EnronOnline Top 200 Natural Gas Users Project. She was instrumental in ensuring the success of this project. By the time Sheila left, we had signed up over 70% of the top US industrial natural gas consumers. Sheila is an exceptionally quick study, as evidenced by her rapid grasp of key derivative concepts and structures. Every week Sheila priced the swaps and options for our customer newsletters. She also priced and helped develop several customized structures for our clients. Finally, Sheila demonstrated and exceptional work ethic that combined with all her other attributes places her among the top summer analysts at Enron. I believe Sheila should receive a full-time job offer from the program. She graduates in May 2001. I am also prepared to offer Sheila a rotation in my group in Global Markets upon her graduation.If you need any further information, please let me know.Thank you for your assistance with this matter.Jen Fraser",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False

"As you may know by now, Congress has adjourned without extending the PTC (see attached).  The Democrats would not support any extenders bill as leverage to get a Stimulus Package passed and everything died.  The Speaker has asked the President to call Congress back on Jan 2 to debate the Stimulus Package, but that seems unlikely. The best we can now hope for is that Congress takes up PTC either as part of the Stimulus Package or an Energy Bill in Feb/March  02.  For the wind co, this is good and bad.  The good is that while the Enron BK has kept customers away, at least now none of our competitors can book orders either.  My hope is that PTC extension and the announcement of a new owner for EW will happen about the same time.  The bad news is that it means our US business will be further hurt - a 200 unit  02 is now out of reach and a 100-125 unit year may be the best we can hope for (assuming the PTC is extended in Q1).  (Maybe the Candover folks knew something we didn t, although I doubt it).  For sale purposes, we will run our  02 numbers at 150 units and put as positive a spin on it for bidders as we can.  Bottom line is that  02 will be a break-even to small profit year for us in the US.Stan - we are in the process of revising our financial projections for a teaser to be sent out to bidders next week and this news will be reflected in those projections (meaning that the sale projections will now differ slightly from what we submitted to Enron earlier this week).  Also, we have launched reductions in force in the US.  I will reduce our MFG workforce by around 85 right after the first of the year and expect to have to let another 100-150 go early in Q1.  I will keep you posted.

House Majority Leader Dick Armey refused to let the Extenders Package come to the House floor because he felt it wouls demonstrate to the Senate Democrats that the House Republicans were not serious about the Stimulus Package. Armey and Bill Thomas got into a shouting match on the floor as Thomas tried to get Armey to move the bill. Thomas and Rangel (the ranking Democrat on Ways and Means) had agreed on a one year extension which is also what the Senate Republicans would agree to.This is partisan politics at its worst. There were no valid public policy reasons to not pass an extenders package Our only option at this point is to go back in January and try to get the extenders passed. They will be looking at an Economic Stimulus Package again if the economic conditions don t improve. There are 15 expiring provisions in the current bill so we will have alot of other groups fighting for extenders.My apologies to all of you.

We will have only one Associate/Analyst Program at Enron, and it is a Company asset.?	We will have a ""One Enron"" presence on campus to provide clarity of message and purpose.?	The Program is rotational in nature, and will prepare our future leaders for success by providing exposure to Enron s network of people and systems.The business prospects for Enron, and the opportunities for personal growth and development have never been better.

"Judge orders Enron to deliver electricity to universitiesUpdated: April 11, 2001 - 2:06 p.m. SAN FRANCISCO -- Saying that Enron Energy Systems Inc. may be in breach of contract, a federal judge Wednesday ordered the Houston company to abide by its agreement to sell cheap power to the state s public universities. Enron was attempting to get out of delivering power for the final year of a four-year deal with the California State University and University of California systems. Enron, which buys power from producers and sells it on the market, said the contract would cost the energy concern $12 million a month because of skyrocketing wholesale power prices. Enron said the state should free Enron from its obligation and taxpayers should pick up the tab. ""It s our economic interest to provide a service with the least amount of dollars we can provide it for,"" Enron attorney A. William Urquhart said. He later described the case as being ""all about money. It s all about money."" Enron said it would file an emergency appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to overturn U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton s ruling in the suit brought by the state s two university systems. Appearing in federal court, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer argued that Enron wants out of the contract so it can engage in a ""marketing game"" with the universities  promised power and sell it on the open market for 10 times more than what the electricity cost Enron. He said lawmakers may have ""left the keys in the car"" when they approved California s failed energy deregulation scheme that has prompted the energy crisis, ""But it is still theft to steal the car."" The judge issued a temporary injunction against Enron, forcing it to continue providing service as the suit brought by the universities proceeds. When the judge issued the order, she also said there is a likelihood Enron will lose the suit. ""I am persuaded, in the end, there is a very strong likelihood of success on the breach of contract claim,"" the judge said. UC s annual electric bill is about $87 million and its natural gas bill is about $26 million. CSU annually pays about $40 million for electricity and $20 million for natural gas. The case is UC Regents vs. Enron Energy Systems Inc., 01-1006. -- Associated Press",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False
"Snady:Here is what our internal counsel in Canada is recommending.Carol St. ClairEB 3892713-853-3989 (Phone)713-646-3393 (Fax)----- Forwarded by Carol St Clair/HOU/ECT on 05/25/2000 04:39 PM -----=09Mark PowellCALECT=09Sent by: Mark Powell=0905/25/2000 02:25 PM=09=09=20=09=09 To: Carol St Clair/HOU/ECT@ECT=09=09 cc: Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT@ECT, Greg Johnston/CAL/ECT@ECT=09=09 Subject: Weyerhaeuser Company Limited ISDAHi Carol,Peter has asked me to respond to your inquiry as to whether or not we can==20agree to the request of Weyerhaeuser Company Limited (""WCL"") in order to=20replace the existing securities representations (as found near the bottom o=f=20this e-mail) in the ISDA to:""It is a Qualified Party within the meaning of the Ontario Securities=20Commission, Rule 91-505 Over-the-Counter Derivatives.""From my perspective, there are four main reasons why this amendment would n=ot=20be appropriate.  They are as follows:1.  Proposed Rule 91-504 - Over-The-Counter Derivatives (""91-504"") and the==20corresponding companion policy have yet to be formally adopted.  At this=20time, 91-504 is merely a proposal.  In addition to checking the Ontario=20Securities Commission (""OSC"") website, I have contacted the lawyer who firs=t=20brought the ""securities representation"" issue to our attention and he has==20confirmed that 91-504 is not yet in place and there have been no recent=20announcements by the OSC with respect to an anticipated timeline for such==20adoption.2.  Even though the WCL may trade through an office in Toronto, any trade==20with Enron Canada Corp. (""Enron Canada"") is likely to be considered a ""trad=e=20within Alberta"" under Alberta securities law (due to the fact that the head==20office and the mind and management of Enron Canada are in Alberta).  As a==20result, it is important that we get representations which address Alberta==20securities law.3.  In a similar vein to point number 2 above, a ""trade"" can take place in =a=20number of jurisdictions depending upon the particular facts of the trade. ==20Although it may seem unlikely, it is possible that trades could possibly be==20made in jurisdictions other than Alberta and Ontario.  With the exception o=f=20British Columbia, I am not aware of other provinces of Canada adopting=20similar ""blanket orders"", ""policies"" or ""rules"" with respect to this issue.= =20However, it is usually Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia which are at t=he=20forefront of Canadian securities law development (with the remaining=20jurisdictions eventually following the leaders).   I expect that, once 91-5=04=20is in place, we will see some movement from the remaining jurisdictions. ==20Regardless, it would seem prudent to leave the reference to British Columbi=a=20in place at this time.4.  I think it is worthwhile to have the parties to the ISDA acknowledge th=e=20fact that a transaction under the ISDA will constitute an ""OTC Derivative""==20(and thus, have the applicable prospectus and registration exemptions=20potentially available to them).  I can think of no reason why it would be==20beneficial to either party to remove this representation.With respect to our physical agreements, we have addressed points 1, 2 and =3=20above (as well as the fact that the exemptions we are relying upon are=20provided by blanket orders and policies {as opposed to the Securities Act==20(Alberta), Securities Act (British Columbia) or Securities Act (Ontario)} a=nd=20are, thus, more likely to be {and more easily} amended) with the following==20clause:""(i) each Transaction shall constitute a =01&commodity contract=018 or an ==01&OTC=20derivative=018 or such other similar term as defined pursuant to the securi=ties=20legislation in force in Alberta or British Columbia or pursuant to the=20securities legislation of any other jurisdictions having application to the==20Transaction, and (ii) it is a =01&Qualified Party=018 within the meaning of==20paragraph 9.1 of Alberta Securities Commission Order Doc.#394043 and=20paragraph 1.1 of the British Columbia Securities Commission Blanket Order==20BOR#91-501, in either case, as amended, restated, replaced or re-enacted fr=om=20time to time, and pursuant to any equivalent order or other enactment made==20pursuant to the securities laws of Alberta, British Columbia or any other==20jurisdictions having application to the Transaction;""I understand that similar language has not been adopted in the ISDA due to==20the ""open-ended"" nature of the above-mentioned clause.  If we want to refer==20to 91-504 and only to the blanket orders and policies currently in place, I==20would suggest that we amend the existing clause, which states:Canadian Securities Acts.  (i) Each Transaction shall constitute an =01&OTC==20Derivative=018 as defined in the Securities Act (Alberta) and the Securitie=s Act=20(British Columbia) which have application to such Transaction and (ii) it i=s=20a =01&Qualified Party=018 within the meaning of paragraph 9.1 of Alberta Se=curities=20Commission Order Doc#394043 and/or paragraph 1.1 of the British Columbia=20Securities Commission Blanket Order BOR#91-501(BC), as in effect on the dat=e=20hereof.to:Canadian Securities Legislation.  (i) Each Transaction shall constitute an==20""OTC derivative"" within the meaning of paragraph 4 of Alberta Securities=20Commission Order Doc#394043 (""ASC 394043""), paragraph 1.1 of British Columb=ia=20Securities Commission Blanket Order BOR#91-501(BC) (""BCSC 91-501"") and/or==20paragraph 1.1 of [proposed] Ontario Securities Commission Rule 91-504 =01)==20Over-The-Counter Derivatives [as published by the Ontario Securities=20Commission on January 7, 2000] (""[Proposed] OSC 91-504""), as applicable to==20such Transaction, (ii) it is a ""Qualified Party"" within the meaning of=20paragraph 9.1 of ASC 394043 and/or paragraph 1.1 of BCSC 91-501, as in effe=ct=20on the date hereof, and (iii) it is a ""qualified party"" within the meaning =of=20paragraph 1.1 of [Proposed] OSC 91-504.Once 91-504 is formally adopted by the OSC, the bold and square bracketed==20language above should be deleted and you may want to amend the ISDAs which==20were drafted using such language.   Similarly, if there are amendments to t=he=20Alberta or British Columbia orders or a province (other than Ontario, Alber=ta=20or British Columbia) which could possibly have/claim some jurisdiction with==20respect to a transaction under the ISDA issues a similar order or policy, y=ou=20may want to amend the clause (and possibly, the pre-existing ISDAs).I hope this discussion is useful for you.

Here are the highlights of today s hearings: Common themes--many tracked ours pretty closelyNot a question of whether rates need to rise, but by how much.Though some oppose any and all rate increases, the lion s share acknowledged that the utilities have a cash flow problem and the a rate increase is necessary.Due process matters. If the Commission is thinking about going as far as ending rate freezes and increasing rates, it better provide for ample due process, or countless law suits will ensue.Don t jump the gun.  A rate increase is likely, but only the utilities benefit from adoption of the utilities  proposals. The Commission needs to carefully scrutinize the utilities  claims and take a careful look at the level of increase required to maintain access to capital markets.  However, as expected, the utilities implored the Commission to jump the gun immediately.  The utilities want the Commission to declare an end to the rate freeze and raise rates on Jan.4.No more divestiture.  The utility should keep the generating assets it retained, but the Commission should ensure that the assets  benefits are allocated equally among all customers.  One legislator recommended that the State buy the utilities  hydro assets, which would give the utilities the cash they need and give the state control over some generation.Treat all customers equally and fairly.The Commission should not create two classes of customers (e.g., large v. small; direct access v. bundled).  No customer group should be sacrificied to save another.Be as narrow as possible/do as little harm as possibleThe immediate problem is the utility s cash/credit crunch.  As such, the Commission should do only enough to solve this very specific, immediate problem.  A modest rate increase is all that s required and the Commission should do no more.At the beginning and the end of the hearing, the President of the Commission asked parties to be prepared (at tomorrow s hearing) to discuss whether the Commission could legally use its other, broad powers to raise rates without declaring an end to the rate freeze.  It seems that she seems some benefit in raising rates, but leaving AB 1890 otherwise intact untill the Commission can Marketers and generators are to blame for the problemThough not universally embraced, the theme came up repeatedly. A few parties (e.g., the Unions, low income consumer groups, one PUC commissioner) called for complete re-regulation of the industry, returning the utilities to vertically integrated monopolies.  But they were the exception rather than the rule at today s hearing.2. Next stepsThere hearings were scheduled to end on Thursay, but now will continue through Friday.Tomorrow, lawyers will provide ""oral"" arguments on whether the Commission must end the rate freeze in order to increase rates.  We will argue that it does not have to, and should not, go through the complex and controversial exercise of determing whether the rate freeze is over between now and 01.04.01.  We will argue that the Commission has the authority to raise rates without ending the rate freeze, and if it decides to raise rates, it should do so while keeping AB 1890 s basic structure in place until a full and fair hearing of the issues is completed.   We are talking to other stakeholders to persuade them to take the same approach.  In terms of legal arguments, this is clearly a long shot, but one that seems worth taking.After the oral argument, the utilities will present their rate proposals and ""all interested persons"" will have the opportunity to cross-examine the utilities (in short, tomorrow will also be a zoo).When asked what the process will be for issuing a proposed decision and providing comments, the President of the Commission responded ""we don t know, it s evolving.""  In other words, the Commission is doing a poor job of ensuring that their Jan 4 decision is ""appeal-proof.""Keep in mind that the situation remains extremely fluid and the trend is still toward ending the rate freeze on Jan. 4th.  We continue to aggressively offer alternatives to that possibility and continue to try to bring other stakeholders to our side.We re doing everything necessary to preserve our appeal rights.We can discuss further on the 10 AM (CST) call tomorrow.Best,Jeff	Roger Yang@EES	12/27/2000 05:43 PM				 To: Leticia Botello/HOU/EES@EES		 cc: Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dennis Benevides/HOU/EES@EES, James W Lewis/HOU/EES@EES, Scott Stoness/HOU/EES@EES, Don Black/HOU/EES@EES, Tony Spruiell/HOU/EES@EES, Mike M Smith/HOU/EES@EES, Meredith M Eggleston/HOU/EES@EES, Neil Hong/HOU/EES@EES, Evan Hughes/HOU/EES@EES, Neil Bresnan/HOU/EES@EES, Jess Hewitt/HOU/EES@EES, Vladimir Gorny/HOU/ECT@ECT, William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Eric Melvin/HOU/EES@EES, Scott Gahn/HOU/EES@EES, Gayle W Muench/HOU/EES@EES, Gordon Savage/HOU/EES@EES, Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enron, Ken Gustafson/HOU/EES@EES, Edward Sacks/Corp/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Marty Sunde/HOU/EES@EES, Dan Leff/HOU/EES@EES, Vicki Sharp/HOU/EES@EES, Kevin Hughes/HOU/EES@EES, Jeremy Blachman/HOU/EES@EES, Harold G Buchanan/HOU/EES@EES, Mark S Muller/HOU/EES@EES, Kathy Bass/HOU/EES@EES, Rosalinda Tijerina/HOU/EES@EES, Debora Whitehead/HOU/EES@EES, Leasa Lopez/HOU/EES@EES, Christina Liscano/HOU/EES@EES, Tasha Lair/HOU/EES@EES, Erika Dupre/HOU/EES@EES, Rita Hennessy/NA/Enron@Enron, Brenda Barreda/HOU/EES@EES, Marsha Suggs/HOU/EES@EES, Carol Moffett/HOU/EES@EES, Kathy Dodgen/HOU/EES@EES, Cathy Corbin/HOU/EES@EES, Sharon Dick/HOU/EES@EES, Beverly Aden/HOU/EES@EES, Tanya Leslie/HOU/EES@EES, Paula Warren/HOU/EES@EES, Wanda Curry/HOU/EES@EES, Ginger Dernehl/NA/Enron@Enron, Dorothy Youngblood/HOU/ECT@ECT, Terri Greenlee/NA/Enron@ENRON, Fran Deltoro/HOU/EES@EES, Iris Waser/HOU/EES@EES		 Subject: Re: Reminder - Level Setting Mtg-California Markets Focus Group EB2868Got an update from Jeff Dasovich.  No earth shattering news.  Comments have been all over the place.  The impression is being made by differing parties that the issues are very complex and would inevitably result in endless lawsuits.  Possible conclusion by the CPUC may be to invoke emergency powers to implement an emergency surcharge and avoid addressing the issue of when the rate freeze ends in these hearings.

The intent of this period (quick overview) is to allow for gas flow Monday through Friday and no flow on the weekends.  This will generally be traded for in full month or rest of the month increments.It is my understanding the although the trade can be conveyed correctly to the customer and priced accordingly using EOL, the trade itself (with Multiple Monday - Friday, no flow during weekend periods) cannot be handled internally by EOL.  Just as EOL is not able to handle this trade, the Sitara bridge from EOL cannot handle this trade.  Because of this, there should be heighten attention by Trade Capture given to the EOL Bridge monitor.  These trades will error out and will have to be entered manually.An effort needs to be evaluated and prioritized by both applications (EOL and Sitara) on how a deal with multi-periods can flow without human intervention.  This has not been started.  In the meantime, a deal of this nature will have to be entered manually.How do I know that a particular deal has multi-period flow?  Once the EOL product has been set up, Jennifer and/or Dale will let all involved know.  The person(s) responsible for entering the deal will have to understand what is meant by the EOL product s delivery period and enter the deal accordingly.  For example, assume that a deal has been traded for April:  Four delivery periods (separate lines) should be included in the Sitara ticket    Start: 04/03 Stop: 04/07   04/10  04/14   04/17  04/21   04/24  04/28    Each delivery period (line) should have the same pricing Remember to enter the EOL deal number when creating the Sitara trade. Also remember that paths created in Unify assume the stop date is open ended.

As noted below, Jim Newsome has been selected as Acting Chair.  I mentioned this to Ken Raisler and Stacy Carey.  Everyone agrees that Newsome is a known quantity, though he may not be a superstar in the mold of Bill Ranier.   Ken said Newsome knows our issues and is favorable to a ""free market"" approach to energy and metals.  However, there is some concern about his ability to reign in the CFTC staff.  Newsome is the favorite currently for the position with boosters in Senators Lott and Cochran and his college roommate Rep. Jerry Moran (R-KS).  However, it is still early in the game and unknown Chair candidates could still be out there (including officials passed over for more high profile positions).If Newsome is nominated as the Chair, an additional Commissioner (a Republican) position opens and will be named by Speaker Denny Hastert.  Hastert is from the suburbs and the assumption is that he the Chicago exchanges may influence the appointment.  Stacy Carey is poking around to determine what Chicago exchanges are thinking.   One name that has been mentioned often is retired Congressman Tom Ewing who has expressed interest in a Commission seat, but not the Chair (Ewing is supportive of our issues).David Spears is also likely to leave, but no date has been announced.  This is also a Republican seat.  The Democrats Barbara Holum and Tom Erickson are likely to stick around until their terms expire.We can try to float names of persons we would like to see either Chair or join the Commission.  Also, we have learned that Wendy Gramm has list of names she may be shopping around for CFTC and SEC - it would be good the see who Gramm is proposing.Please advise how you want to proceed in either reviewing or suggesting the appointees.Thanks - Chris	No. 05 Monday January 8, 2001	Page A-4 	ISSN 1523-567X	Regulation, Law & Economics		Futures TradingNewsome Elected Acting Chair;Favors  Free-Market  PhilosophyThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission has elected Jim Newsome as its acting chairman, the agency announced Jan. 5. Newsome, a Republican, will assume the role played by outgoing Chairman William Rainer, who announced last month that he would resign his position effective Jan. 19. Newsome, a native of Plant City, Fla., was nominated to the CFTC in July 1998 and sworn in Aug. 10 that same year. Immediately before joining the commission, Newsome was chairman of the Mississippi Agribusiness Council and served as executive vice president of the Mississippi Cattlemen s Association and Mississippi Beef Council. Levels of OversightNewsome, who could not be reached for comment Jan. 5, told BNA last month that he favors a ""free-market philosophy,"" something he said helped him work productively with the like-minded Rainer, who was a Democrat. He praised in particular the CFTC s new regulatory framework that was approved by the commission last fall. The rulemaking largely was withdrawn after Congress essentially codified the initiative in the Commodity Futures Modernization Act passed in December. The new tiered-system creates different levels of oversight meant to differentiate between different levels of investor sophistication.

"Good Morning! Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month. For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston s low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow. So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation s gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter.

The senior White & Case lawyers who worked on the deal have either changed firms or retired.Highlights: --Hatch spent much of the morning on the off-take agreements and their description in the offering memo.? Izower strongly defended offering memo s description of the off-take agreements as accurate but would not cooperate with Hatch when asked to point out where in the off-take agreements Preussag or Klockner were ""obligated"" to purchase NSM s steel.? Izower s counsel objected to the questions as calling for a legal conclusion.? --Hatch walked Izower through the various drafts of the off-take agreements and asked if Izower had discussed the changes with the ""underwriting group.""? Izower testified that most of the comments were received from Gleacher Natwest, McDonald, Cravath and SDI.? Izower produced a responsibility schedule concerning certain documents related to the offering with completion dates.? Enron/ECT is not mentioned in the document as having had any role in the drafting although Izower did mention, as an afterthought, that Enron and Paine Webber may also have provided comments on the off-take agreements.--Hatch established that the offering memo failed to disclose the existence of certain material agreements such as: a)????? Employment agreements between NSM and Swasdi Horrungruang and NSM and Chamni Janchai (who was thought of as being a crook) pursuant to which they received an annual salary of $350,000 for ten years;b)????? A Throughput Agreement between Sriracha Harbor and NSM pursuant to which NSM offering proceeds would be diverted to the Harbor (which Swasdi had an ownership interest in) and to certain Thai banks who were owed sums from the Harbor.? Apparently, the Thai banks were threatening a foreclosure and take over of the Harbor jeopardizing NSM s ability to import and export materials.? The payment sums are not disclosed.? In less than convincing fashion, Izower indicated that the agreement was probably not mentioned in the offering memo as it may not have qualified as ""related party transaction.""--Izower had no idea why the legal, financial and advisory fees on the NSM deal had increased from $29 million to $35 million.This e-mail message may contain legally privileged and/or confidential information.

Sorry for the mixed signals.  al>>> ""Howard J. Weg"" <hweg@pgwlaw.com> 08/28/01 09:35PM >>>I have not heard back from all members of the Unofficial Committee regardingmy email dated August 27, 2001 with respect to the proposal to contact theGovernor and Legislators regarding the pending legislation on SCE.Some have suggested that the message needs to be stronger and others havesuggested that the message is too strong.  Our Ex Officio members BPA andWAPA want it to be clear that they are not involved in any way withaddressing the state government on this or other issues.  As you know, Iwant very much to reach as broad of a consensus on this action as ispossible, and to protect the interests of all members.Virtually all members agree that a bankruptcy case for or litigation againstSCE would probably not be a good thing and we do not want to advocate forbankruptcy or litigation.  After all, the Unofficial Committee was organizedto provide a different approach generally.  The purpose of contacting theGovernor and the Legislature is to let them know that the legislation theyare now considering, which leaves SCE about $1 billion short on the proposedfinancing to pay creditors, may cause some other sellers to take precipitousaction in filing an involuntary petitition or initiating litigation orarbitration that could delay or prevent the financing at even the lower $2.9billion level, which will adversly affect SCE and all creditors generally.We should point out that not all sellers are in agreement on what actionwill be taken. The message is not intended to threaten anything and it isnot necessarily designed to stop legislation altogether, only legislationthat might actually make the situation worse for all sellers and SCE.The tone of the presentation, if we make one, will be low key, nonthreatening, and in the spirit of helping the legislature and the Governordesign a package that will avoid the bankruptcy, litigation and otheralternatives that others might be forced to consider if the bill is passed,leaving the energy sellers out in the cold.If there remain some members of the Committee that are not willing to beassociated with the message outlined above, then I propose that we give suchmembers the alternative of remaining members of the Unofficial Committee andallowing us, if asked, to identify any such members that prefer not to be apart of the message although they want to support an approach that avoidslitigation and bankruptcy for SCE.  I understand that the LADWP and CoralPower would like this approach adopted.As I explained in my prior email, it has been suggested that the proposedbill that leaves SCE short by a billion dollars will likely pass after LaborDay and before the Sept 14 adjournment.

I met with Byron Kelley who runs El Paso s international business.  He is an old business aquaintance that I had not visited with in several years.  Byron assured me that he would stop the type of press like the article you sent.  He reiterated although that El Paso has had good success in dealing with the government in a very private way and did not want to publicise any differences that they may have with the government from time to time.  He was willing to stop the press articles that defined differences between El Paso and Enron in their approach to Brazil but had no desire to join Enron in publically trying to effectuate change in Brazil.  The meeting was very friendly.

Guys --We need to quickly put together some talking points on how to respond to AEP s request for delay until 2003.  My understanding is that AEP in Texas is wholly outside of ERCOT (if wrong - please inform).  AEP needs only to file a good amendment to the FERC OATT (or SPP needs to do it for them) ASAP.  My basic model for provisioning of energy for retail competition in non-ERCOT Texas is that delivery to the border of the OATT provider (for instance delivering a into-Entergy product into Arkansas and paying for losses would be sufficient for delivery into the Woodlands).Jean was going to call Luiz to get this issue on the burner.Thanks,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False

"Marty:  I will have a response to setoff shortly.  With respect to the CSA and calculation of the ""Credit Support Amount,"" our change should not create any inconsistencies in the calculation of that amount among your counterparties since it would only change IF the calculation yielded a negative number.  The only reason for ""specifying otherwise"" in Paragraph 13 is to capture the situation where the Pledgor MIGHT be holding Independent Amounts (if there are ever any specified in a particular Transaction) of the Secured Party as cushion (which is not meant to be returned until termination of Transactions) and subtraction of that amount would create a negative number when calculating the Credit Support Amount.  By specifying that the Credit Support Amount will be ""the higher of"" the amount calculated (deemed to be zero if a negative number) or the sum of the Pledgor s Independent Amounts, the latter would prevail.  This calculation method will make a difference if, for example, the Secured Party asks for a Return Amount when the Pledgor intends to retain any Independent Amounts as cushion (such that only Posted Credit Support exceeding the sum of the Independent Amounts will be returned).  I hope this helps.

"Good Morning! Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month. For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston s low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow.

(APXc), a leading provider of online markets for the electric power industry, today announced that John Yurkanin has joined APX as its new president and chief executive officer (CEO). Yurkanin, former chief operating officer of the California Power Exchange (CalPX), has two decades of experience in the energy industry, including oil, gas, and electric power. ``I am very pleased to be taking the helm of APX,   said Yurkanin. ``The APX approach - using the Internet to foster open and neutral markets for power trading and delivery - is just what the U.S. and international markets of today and tomorrow need. APX has assembled an exceptionally talented group of people who are developing the leading Internet-based marketplace for the electric power industry.   Yurkanin, a career energy industry executive, brings an international, multi-commodity perspective to his new role at APX, from his past roles at British Petroleum, Louisville Gas and Electric, and most recently CalPX. He had served as executive vice president and chief operating officer for the CalPX since December 1998 with responsibility for internal operations. This included all trading operations, market services, settlement operations, marketing, and information technology efforts. ``APX, as a provider of open markets, is an important part of the resolution of California s volatile electricity market, as well as aiding other deregulating markets around the globe,   said Yurkanin. ``This is important not only on a regional, but also on a global level, for the lessons being learned in California will shape the course of markets around the world. In joining APX, I am able to bring my recent public sector experience back into the private sector, where I have spent most of my career.   Prior to joining CalPX, Yurkanin served as Louisville Gas and Electric Energy Corp. s (LG&E) senior vice president for marketing and operations in its non-regulated businesses with responsibility for operating assets associated with the 24-hour power operations and gas control facilities. He also directed LG&E s retail marketing, regulatory strategy, and products and services development for emerging power and gas markets. Yurkanin also was a principal in two energy consulting firms for two years after his lengthy tenure with British Petroleum (BP), which extended from 1981 until 1994. At BP, he advanced through a number of positions associated with crude oil trading, and North American and European oil and gas marketing. From 1992 to 1994, he served as vice president for BP Gas, with responsibilities for the start-up of U.S. commodity marketing and trading operations to manage BP s equity production of gas and liquid hydrocarbons. Richard Amen, who had served as APX CEO since May 2000, will resume his role as managing partner of Venture Management Associates (VMA), which provides investment capital and management assistance for rapidly growing technology companies. Yurkanin earned a master of business administration, with emphasis in finance and management, from Xavier University of Ohio, and holds a bachelor of science degree in chemistry from the University of Cincinnati. About Automated Power Exchange Automated Power Exchange operates Internet-based markets for the buying and selling of electric power, renewable power, and related products and provides the market and scheduling technologies needed to support power system administration. A privately held company with approximately 100 employees, APX has its world headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif., and its European headquarters in London.

""My Daddy,"" he said,""pretends to be people."" There have been quite a few of them.Prophets from the Old and New Testaments, a couple ofChristian saints, generals of various nationalities and differentcenturies, several kings, three American presidents, a Frenchcardinal and two geniuses, including Michelangelo. If you want theceiling re-painted I ll do my best. There always seem to be a lotof different fellows up here. I m never sure which one of them getsto talk. Right now, I guess I m the guy.As I pondered our visit tonight it struck me: If my creator gave methe gift to connect you with the hearts and minds of thosegreat men, then I want to use that same gift now to re-connect youwith your own sense of liberty ... your own freedom ofthought ... your own compass for what is right. Dedicating thememorial at Gettysburg, Abraham Lincoln said of America, ""We arenow engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether this nation orany nation so conceived and so dedicated can longendure."" Those words are true again. I believe that we are againengaged in a great civil war, a cultural war that s about tohijack your birthright to think and say what resides in your heart.I fear you no longer trust the pulsing lifeblood of liberty insideyou ... the stuff that made this country rise from wilderness intothe miracle that it is.Let me back up. About a year ago I became president of the NationalRifle Association, which protects the right to keep andbear arms. I ran for office, I was elected, and now I serve ... Iserve as a moving target for the media who ve called meeverything from ""ridiculous"" and ""duped"" to a ""brain-injured,senile, crazy old man."" I know ... I m pretty old ... but I surethank the Lord ain t senile. As I have stood in the crosshairs ofthose who target Second Amendment freedoms, I ve realized thatfirearms are not the only issue. No, it s much, much bigger thanthat. I ve come to understand that a cultural war is raging acrossour land, in which, with Orwellian fervor, certain acceptablethoughts and speech are mandated.For example, I marched for civil rights with Dr. King in 1963 --long before Hollywood found it fashionable. But when I told anaudience last year that white pride is just as valid as black prideor red pride or anyone else s pride, they called me a racist.I ve worked with brilliantly talented homosexuals all my life. Butwhen I told an audience that gay rights should extend nofurther than your rights or my rights, I was called a homophobe.I served in World War II against the Axis powers. But during aspeech, when I drew an analogy between singling out innocent Jewsand singling out innocent gun owners, I was called an anti-Semite.Everyone I know knows I would never raise a closed fist against mycountry. But when I asked an audience to oppose thiscultural persecution, I was compared to Timothy McVeigh.>From Time magazine to friends and colleagues, they re essentiallysaying, ""Chuck, how dare you speak your mind. You areusing language not authorized for public consumption!""But I am not afraid. If Americans believed in politicalcorrectness, we d still be King George s boys-subjects bound to theBritish crown.In his book, ""The End of Sanity,"" Martin Gross writes that""blatantly irrational behavior is rapidly being established as thenorm in almost every area of human endeavor. There seem to be newcustoms, new rules, new anti-intellectual theories regularlyfoisted on us from every direction.Underneath, the nation is roiling. Americans know something,without a name is undermining the nation, turning the mindmushy when it comes to separating truth from falsehood and rightfrom wrong. And they don t like it.""Let me read a few examples. At Antioch college in Ohio, young menseeking intimacy with a coed must get verbal permission at eachstep of the process from kissing to petting to final copulation ...all clearly spelled out in a printed college directive. In NewJersey, despite the death of several patients nationwide who hadbeen infected by dentists who had concealed their AIDS --- thestate commissioner announced that health providers who areHIV-positive need not. .. need not ... tell their patients thatthey are infected.At William and Mary, students tried to change the name of theschool team ""The Tribe"" because it was supposedly insultingto local Indians, only to learn that authentic Virginia chiefstruly like the name.In San Francisco, city fathers passed an ordinance protecting therights of transvestites to cross-dress on the job, and fortranssexuals to have separate toilet facilities while undergoingsex change surgery.In New York City, kids who don t speak a word of Spanish have beenplaced in bilingual classes to learn their three R s inSpanish solely because their last names sound Hispanic. At theUniversity of Pennsylvania, in a state where thousands diedat Gettysburg opposing slavery, the president of that collegeofficially set up segregated dormitory space for black students.Yeah, I know ... that s out of bounds now. Dr. King said ""Negroes.""Jimmy Baldwin and most of us on the March said ""black."" But it s ano-no now.For me, hyphenated identities are awkward ... particularly""Native-American."" I m a Native American, for God s sake. I alsohappen to be a blood-initiated brother of the Miniconjou Sioux. Onmy wife s side, my grandson is a 13th-generation Native American... with a capital letter on ""American."" Finally, just last month... David Howard, head of the Washington D.C. Office of PublicAdvocate, used the word ""niggardly"" while talking to colleaguesabout budgetary matters. Of course,  niggardly  means stingy orscanty. But within days Howard was forced to publicly apologize andresign.As columnist Tony Snow wrote: ""David Howard got fired because somepeople in public employ were morons who (a) didn t know the meaningof  niggardly,  (b) didn t know how to use a dictionary to discoverthe meaning, and ,actually demanded that he apologize for theirignorance."" What does all of this mean? It means that telling uswhat to think has evolved into telling us what to say, so tellingus what to do can t be far behind.Before you claim to be a champion of free thought, tell me: Why didpolitical correctness originate on America s campuses?And why do you continue to tolerate it? Why do you, who re supposedto debate ideas, surrender to their suppression?Let s be honest. Who here thinks your professors can say what theyreally believe? It scares me to death, and should scareyou too, that the superstition of political correctness rules thehalls of reason.You are the best and the brightest. You, here in the fertile cradleof American academia, here in the castle of learning on theCharles River, you are the cream. But I submit that you, and yourcounterparts across the land, are the most sociallyconformed and politically silenced generation since Concord Bridge.And as long as you validate that ... and abide it ... you are-byyour grandfathers  standards-cowards.Here s another example. Right now at more than one majoruniversity, Second Amendment scholars and researchers arebeing told to shut up about their findings or they ll lose theirjobs. Why? Because their research findings would underminebig-city mayor s pending lawsuits that seek to extort hundreds ofmillions of dollars from firearm manufacturers.I don t care what you think about guns. But if you are not shockedat that, I am shocked at you. Who will guard the rawmaterial of unfettered ideas, if not you? Who will defend the corevalue of academia, if you supposed soldiers of free thoughtand expression lay down your arms and plead, ""Don t shoot me."" Ifyou talk about race, it does not make you a racist. If yousee distinctions between the genders, it does not make you asexist. If you think critically about a denomination, it does notmake you anti-religion. If you accept but don t celebratehomosexuality, it does not make you a homophobe.Don t let America s universities continue to serve as incubatorsfor this rampant epidemic of new McCarthyism. But what can you do?How can anyone prevail against such pervasive social subjugation?The answer s been here all along. I learned it 36 years ago, on thesteps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C.,standing with Dr. Martin Luther King and two hundred thousandpeople. You simply ... disobey. Peaceably, yes. Respectfully, ofcourse. Nonviolently, absolutely. But when told how to think orwhat to say or how to behave, we don t. We disobey social protocolthat stifles and stigmatizes personal freedom.I learned the awesome power of disobedience from Dr. King ... wholearned it from Gandhi, and Thoreau and Jesus and every other greatman who led those in the right against those with the might.Disobedience is in our DNA. We feel innate kinship with thatDisobedient spirit that tossed tea into Boston Harbor, that sentThoreau to jail, that refused to sit in the back of the bus, thatprotested a war in Vietnam.In that same spirit, I am asking you to disavow culturalcorrectness with massive disobedience of rogue authority, socialdirectives and onerous law that weaken personal freedom.But be careful ... it hurts. Disobedience demands that you putyourself at risk. Dr. King stood on lots of balconies. You mustbe willing to be humiliated ... to endure the modern-day equivalentof the police dogs at Montgomery and the water Cannons at Selma.You must be willing to experience discomfort. I m not Complaining,but my own decades of social activism have taken their toll on me.Let me tell you a story.A few years back I heard about a rapper named Ice-T who was sellinga CD called ""Cop Killer"" celebrating ambushing andmurdering police officers. It was being marketed by none other thanTime/Warner, the biggest entertainment conglomerate in the world.Police across the country were outraged. Rightfully so-at least onehad been murdered. But Time/Warner wasstonewalling because the CD was a cash cow for them, and the mediawere tiptoeing around it because the rapper was black.I heard Time/Warner had a stockholders meeting scheduled in BeverlyHills. I owned some shares at the time, so I decided to attend.What I did there was against the advice of my family andcolleagues. I asked for the floor. To a hushed room of athousand average American stockholders, I simply read the fulllyrics of ""Cop Killer""-every vicious, vulgar, instructional word.""I GOT MY 12 GAUGE SAWED OFFI GOT MY HEADLIGHTS TURNED OFFI m ABOUT TO BUST SOME SHOTS OFFI m ABOUT TO DUST SOME COPS OFF...""It got worse, a lot worse. I won t read the rest of it to you. Buttrust me, the room was a sea of shocked, frozen, blanchedfaces. The Time/Warner executives squirmed in their chairs andstared at their shoes. They hated me for that.Then I delivered another volley of sick lyric brimming with racistfilth, where Ice-T fantasizes about sodomizing two 12-year oldnieces of Al and Tipper Gore. ""SHE PUSHED HER BUTT AGAINST MY ....""Well, I won t do to you here what I did to them. Let s just say Ileft the room in echoing silence.When I read the lyrics to the waiting press corps, one of them said""We can t print that."" ""I know,"" I replied, ""but Time/Warner _sselling it.""Two months later, Time/Warner terminated Ice-T s contract. I llnever be offered another film by Warners, or get a good review fromTime magazine. But disobedience means you must be willing to act,not just talk.When a mugger sues his elderly victim for defending herself ... jamthe switchboard of the district attorney s office. When youruniversity is pressured to lower standards until 80 percent of thestudents graduate with honors ... choke the halls of the board ofregents. When an 8-year-old boy pecks a girl s cheek on theplayground and gets hauled into court for sexual harassment...march on that school and block its doorways.When someone you elected is seduced by political power and betraysyou ... petition them, oust them, banish them. WhenTime magazine s cover portrays millennium nuts as deranged, crazyChristians holding a cross as it did last month ... boycotttheir magazine and the products it advertises.So that this nation may long endure, I urge you to follow in thehallowed footsteps of the great disobediences of history thatfreed exiles, founded religions, defeated tyrants, and yes, in thehands of an aroused rabble in arms and a few great men, byGod s grace, built this country.If Dr. King were here, I think he would agree.Thank you. - att1.htm",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False

Although he wanted to schedule theevidentiary hearing for the last week in September, the Commisssion scalendar is currently full.  So he has tentatively scheduled it for Monday,October 2.  The problem with that is that it makes it virtually impossibleto meet the November 1 construction date if the Commission allows thecustomary 30 days after the hearing in which to file briefs and proposedorders.  I urged Sami to please see if he could calendar the hearing for thethird week in September.  One of the things that ENA will have to do is to have notice published innewspapers in the Rocky Mount area for several consecutive weeks prior tothe hearing so that affected persons will have an opportunity to comment.  Iam trying to get Sami to place the draft agenda item and procedural scheduleon the Commission s July 31 Open Agenda Conference so that the notices canstart to run August 7.  That action, along with scheduling the hearing forthe third week in September, will make it far more likely than not that theCPCN will issue before November 1.  Failing that, we can work with the Public Staff to shorten the period withinwhich to file briefs and proposed orders after the hearing to three orpreferably two weeks.  It will not be difficult to do that if there are nointervenors, or if the intervenors do not object.Sami has promised to let me know by tomorrow when the agenda item will gobefore the Commission, and the dates in the procedural schedule.

None of the utilities would try to claimit isn t protected, because then they would have to reveal theirinformation.  CUCA could try to get it in order to participate in thehearing, but CUCA generally supports IPP development (in general), andJamie would have to sign a nondisclosure agreement and not reveal theinformation to anyone.

Naturally we would be pleased if you would be able to stay for the entire conference, but knowing your schedule, you may only have time for a part of it.  That would not be a problem.  The usual after-dinner address is for 30 minutes, followed by a short Q&A period.Your presentation would help to underline the tremendous importance of Enron in driving the development of new risk instruments to assist in price discovery and efficient risk management for market participants, in energy markets and more generally.  Both Michael and I feel that your perspectives on the ""new science of risk management"" and what can be expected from it could be a very important addition to this special anniversay event.Please let me know (and please do copy Michael on your response) whether your schedule will allow your participation in this very special event.  Michael and I would, of course, be very happy to follow up with you in discussing the nature of the presentation, participants and so forth, if this is a go.  I look forward to hearing from you.Regards,PaulPaul Kleindorfer215 898-5830",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False

Since no changes have been made in GCP to correct the HQ company and trade name relationships, the recent ISDA contract was set up under Nicor Gas Company.

Therefore, Nicor Gas Company is the only entity that all the deals needs to be booked under. However, the attorney also agreed to the fact that they do use the name ""Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company"" eversince the name change happened. He said they had been using both names ""contractually"" and interchangeably even though it is all just ONE company, one state registered company.I m currently waiting on name change documents, however this is what it looks like thats going to happen:The main HQ company would end up being NICOR GAS COMPANY with all the trades/contracts/deals being merged into one record. However, if need be we could have a Tradename set up as ""Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company"" since this is how the company does business as, in some cases.Nicor s legal Dept could be reached at (630) 983-8676 for any further clarifications in this matter.Adnan PatelGlobal Counterpartyx58335From: Tana Jones@ECT on 08/17/2000 03:47 PMTo: Stacy E Dickson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tom Moran/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Frank L Davis/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stephanie Sever/HOU/ECT@ECT, Adnan Patel/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Northern Illinois Gas Company/Nicor Gas CompanyThere appears to be confusion over who and what products we should be trading with these entities.We have an ISDA Master Agreement in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company.

In order to enhance and maintain the value of the site (we re trying to sell it now) I have gotten Ben s authorization to secure an additional 12 month extension on the deal for $10,000.I spoke to the landowner - Dick Greene - and he indicated that they would consider it, although he has never been in favor of an option structure since  he is 80 years old and just wants the money from the sale.  The concept I pitched today was that we would pay them for the 6 month extension, and give them an additional $5000 now in exchange for adding another 12 month extension on the back.  At the time we exercise that 12 month extension we would pay them another $5000.  He said he would have to hear what his lawyer said in this regard, but I think its close to a deal.  Perhaps we could arrange a conference call with Karen Way at Piper-Rudnick as she has dealt extensively with their lawyer Ed Legner.  Its good timing to hit him now, since he does a lot of tax work so he will want to wrap us up quickly.As regards accounting issues, the total exercise price is 117 acres * $4500 / ac. = $526,500, and 5% = $26,325.  Total option premiums (including this extension I am proposing) will be $20,000.

We explained that we wanted the Distributors to have every incentive to cooperate w/ us in keeping those damages minimized.  They might be willing to concede on this point if we can work out everything else.  (3)  EPMI s Cover Damages --  They are not very comfortable agreeing to the concept that a Distributor would have to pay damages to EPMI b/c they cannot imagine how they could be responsible for failing to receive an ""into"" product such as this.  We both agreed to reconsider this.(4)  Criteria for Enron s rejection of Distributor -- Our right to approve Distributors is ok, but they want to add language to prevent EPMI from being arbitrary about those approvals.  We agreed.(5)  Notice of changes to underlying agreements -- Their duty to notify us it ok, but they want to add language that is in line w/ their Distributor agreements, which don t absolutely require Distributors to tell TEPAC everything.  We agreed.(6)  Request for offers --  They would prefer that EPMI call them every day w/ quotes (which is how Williams does it now), rather than having to initiate the process.  We described this as our normal way of doing business and they agreed.(7)  Indemnity clause -- We struck a sentence about each party indemnifying the other while they have title to the power, which had been included in our earlier draft.  I agreed to look into this.  (8)  Governing Law and Arbitration -- TEPAC is ok w/ NY law, but would prefer including a clause requiring EPMI to sue TEPAC or any distributor in Tennessee (even tho Keith thinks that would be the legal result anyway).   They would also prefer to have the arbitration situs in Tennessee.  We both agreed to reconsider this.  Richard:  What do you think about that?Any comments are welcome.Regards,JaniceEB3861Assistant General Counsel, Enron North America Corp.713-853-1794 (Fax:  713-646-4842)",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False

Many of the current leaders of our company are also graduates of the Program.Three broad principles will continue to guide the direction of the Program.?	We will have only one Associate/Analyst Program at Enron, and it is a Company asset.?	We will have a ""One Enron"" presence on campus to provide clarity of message and purpose.?	The Program is rotational in nature, and will prepare our future leaders for success by providing exposure to Enron s network of people and systems.The business prospects for Enron, and the opportunities for personal growth and development have never been better.

This year will be, in fact, the 20th anniversary conference and a number of notable personages will be joining us to celebrate what we have learned and what we haven t about the economics of network industries.  Fred Kahn, Al Philipps, Bill Hogan and a number of other distinguished academics will be reviewing our progress and the prospects for the future.  The conference will take place at a beautiful site in the Poconos, about 90 minutes north of Philadelphia, from Wednesday afternoon May 24th to Friday afternoon May 26th.  You can check for yourself the nature of the program and the conference site/hotel at the following website URL: http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~crri/WS.htm Michael Crew and I would both be delighted if you would be willing to be an after dinner speaker on Thursday evening (May 25th), just before the key research reviews of Friday morning take place on the electricity, telephone and gas industries, and following a day of special topics on emerging power markets and other developments in network industries.   Naturally we would be pleased if you would be able to stay for the entire conference, but knowing your schedule, you may only have time for a part of it.  That would not be a problem.  The usual after-dinner address is for 30 minutes, followed by a short Q&A period. Your presentation would help to underline the tremendous importance of Enron in driving the development of new risk instruments to assist in price discovery and efficient risk management for market participants, in energy markets and more generally.  Both Michael and I feel that your perspectives on the ""new science of risk management"" and what can be expected from it could be a very important addition to this special anniversay event. Please let me know (and please do copy Michael on your response) whether your schedule will allow your participation in this very special event.

They are apparently revisiting things there.  So here is my reaction to the APS filing, which I had not heard about.It is my recollection that the spin off is part of the entire-ball-of-wax settlement approved by the ACC for the APS restructuring in 10/99.  Therefore they must have filed to reopen this settlement (which was not to be allowed, of course).  The settlement, while ""opening"" markets, effectively keeps them closed for lack of headroom until 7/04 at the earliest.  So, if there is a commercial interest in AZ, then this filing could give us a chance to jump back in and make the arguments we made back in 99 that the settlement would not result in competition (and it didn t - time has proved us 100% correct on that) and if APS wants to change the settlement, then the non-competitive terms should be amended as well.That said, we do not get a great reception in AZ, and it is hard to say we would have any great chance of success.  The large customers do not mind that there is no competition because they have been on a mandated rate reduction path and saw none of the price run-ups that Californians and other westerners saw last winter (at least not yet).  We would have no one on our side.  SO, it is an opening, but I would let the commercial folks tell us how much it is worth to them, given the less than great odds. -----Original Message-----From: 	Nord, Sue  Sent:	Tuesday, October 23, 2001 3:53 PMTo:	Keene, Patrick; Lawner, LeslieSubject:	FW: APS Filing Is this something in which you think we should be engaged? -----Original Message-----From: 	Steffes, James D.

The October contract rose $0.107 to $3.232 per MMBtu. Tropica=l Storm Barry is expected to strengthen today and move into the north-centr=al Gulf of Mexico. Some weather forecasts expect that the storm will turn i=nto a hurricane, and the growing likelihood that workers will soon have to =be taken off Gulf of Mexico natural gas platforms has put traders on alert.= But, despite the storm risk, there was only limited short-covering and vol=ume was fairly light. However, strength in crude and products as well as Tr=opical Storm Barry encouraged buying by both trade, commercial accounts and= the locals. Fundamentally, the market is still bearish, but that could cha=nge quickly if the storm does impact production. Sell stops were triggered =as prices moved through the $3.20 level late in the session, bringing the m=arket off its highs. On Wednesday, the market dropped over $0.20 following =the release of AGA report data showing an injection of 77 Bcf last week. Ho=t weather is forecast for much of the nation early next week, with the West= Coast returning to hot weather next week. Natural gas for next day deliver=y across the US and Canada was generally $0.10 to $0.15 per MMBtu lower yes=terday, except out West where spot price climbed. Natural gas for next day =delivery at the Henry hub lost $0.17 to $3.15 per MMBtu.

The storm is most likely= to make landfall on Sunday in Louisiana. Companies with offshore productio=n have already taken steps to protect workers by moving them onshore until =the storm passes but they added that they had not yet suspended any product=ion. The National Hurricane Center forecasters predicts that Barry would mo=ve slowly to the northwest, taking it through the main producing areas of t=he central Gulf with a 55% chance that it would attain hurricane strength a=s it heads toward New Orleans. Chevron has evacuated 700 workers from offsh=ore platforms as a precaution against the storm and will make further evacu=ations today. The Gulf of Mexico provides about one quarter of nation s pro=duction of both natural gas and crude oil; about 13 Bcf of natural gas per =day and 1.4 million barrels of oil.=20--------------------------------------------------------              JUST COMPLETED - AVAILABLE NOW             NORTHEAST U.S. AND EASTERN CANADAZiff Energy Group s Multi-Client Study:Beyond the Midwest: Focusing on the Northeast Opportunities!Are you active in the US Northeast?

Public utilities which are loca=ted in competitive markets would no longer be bound by existing tax law str=ictly limiting private use of facilities financed with tax-exempt bonds. Ho=wever, they can continue to issue tax exempt financing for a limited amount= of generation to serve their own load, but not for service outside their l=ocal area. Private and public utilities say they are satisfied with the bil=l, nut private utilities are disappointed that the bill left out a provisio=n eliminating taxes on contributions in aid of construction. The bill inclu=des measures that allow public power systems to join RTOs in order to impro=ve the national transmission grid, without endangering outstanding bonds. T=he bill also makes an exception for prepaid natural gas contracts, which wo=uld apply only if at least 85% of the purchased volumes were for use by gov=ernmental utilities in the state where the bond issuer was located.=20-------------------------------------------------------- PNW 2001:Current Realities, Future ExpectationsPacific Northwest Gas Strategies ConferenceOctober 2,2001 Portland,Oregon (at the Hilton Portland)Hear Commissioner Wilson Condon, State of Alaska, describe how Alaska gas s=upply will energize the Pacific Northwest supply portfolio.

The California PUC claims that El Paso unfairly award=ed 1.2 Bcf per day of firm capacity to its affiliate, El Paso Merchant Ener=gy. Before the start of testimony, the FERC ALJ said that an April 2000 mem=orandum sent between Wise and another  official relates the minute details =of everything that is happening in the company, showing that Mr. Wise was w=ell aware of everything. That seems to run contrary to Wise s testimony at =the previous May  hearing, where testified he did not micromanage the affai=rs of El Paso s subsidiaries. The California PUC testified that El Paso awa=rded the capacity in question by skewing the rules of an open season, sayin=g it biased the open season in favor of the  total package  bid. If a singl=e bid for all of the capacity exceeded $37.5 million, then individual bids =could only succeed if they exceeded the value of the total package bid to E=l Paso.  Therefore, even if they submitted partial package bids at reasonab=ly high rates, their success was totally dependent upon the other partial p=ackage bids by other shippers. A total of 24 shippers submitted partial bid=s, and none of them were awarded any capacity, the PUC said. But El Paso di=sputed those claims, saying that it made the minimum economic criteria befo=re the open season, thus giving no one an advantage.=20--------------------------------------------------------                  YOU DESIGNED IT.

The Ladyfern are=a, located in an isolated section of northeastern British Columbia, is esti=mated to contain up to 1 Tcf. Murphy Oil and Apache jointly drilled the fir=st discovery well in the region a year ago, which is about 60 miles northea=st of the oil hub, Fort St. John, BC. Acreage in the Ladyfern region has so=ld for 17 times the median paid for acreage in other parts of BC. It is lik=ely second in size to the 1.8 Tcf Caroline, Alberta field in terms of Canad=ian onshore discoveries. Production is estimated at 480 MMcf per day. Canad=ian Natural is now producing 55 MMcf per day from one well, which is restri=cted by pipeline capacity. It expects to be producing 200 MMcf per day by t=he end of the year. Alberta Energy s output is about 170 MMcf per day.=20-----------------------------------------------------Enerfax Job Center & NewsNew Openings include:* Pipeline Compliance Specialist* Software Sales* Jr/Sr Derivative/Risk AnalystVisit http://www.enernetenergy/  for these and more new job listings.=20--------------------------------------------------------* Principal Sales Executive - Viking Gas Transmission, A Subsidiary of Xcel= Energy=20This position is located in St. Paul, Minnesota and is responsible for the =development and implementation of all gas transportation sales activities, =customer contacts, customer service and increasing market share.Accountable for annually increasing transportation revenue and improving co=mpany profitability.

Even the governor s c=hief spokesman has $12,000 invested in Calpine. Consumer groups and Republi=cans are claiming conflict of interest among top Democratic officials charg=ed with helping California out of its energy crisis. But the governor says =it is a politically inspired witch hunt aimed at smearing his administratio=n by implying something is illegal.

"----- Forwarded by Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT on 12/01/2000 07:56 AM -----	""Fergus, Gary S."" <GFergus@brobeck.com>	10/24/2000 04:45 PM		 		 To: ""Richard B. Sanders Esq. (E-mail)"" <richard.b.sanders@enron.com>		 cc: ""Meringolo, Peter"" <PMeringolo@brobeck.com>		 Subject: Some thoughts on optionsPRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIALATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGERichard, After today s discussion here are our brainstorming ideas onoptions:1.   WAIT FOR A BETTER PROTECTIVE ORDER Ask Harvey Morris where they are on fixing the protective order thatis being litigated by others.  If the protective order has not  changed,then unilaterally postpone production until it is.  Pro: Better protectionand more time; Con: Even with a more stringent protective order Enron still questions whether the PUC is entitledto financial performance data.  Thus, this option does not fullydisclose all of Enron s positions and the company may be accused later ofsimply engaging in delaying tactics.  Under this option  we file ourformal objections as well.2. TURN OVER THE TRANSACTION DATA AS IS Continue on our present course of turning over transaction data forelectricity that was delivered.  Pro: PUC will get the data  anywayeither through FERC, unfair competition, antitrust or price gouginglitigation.  By turning over the data that will show  profits, PUC mightslow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business byseeking to depose witnesses etc.  Con:  This would be waiving thelegitimate question that Enron has as to the PUC s ability to discovery thisinformation through a  subpoena.  There is also a question of howconfidential this data would be given the current political agenda.  Itmight also serve  to whet the appetite of the PUC for more Enroninformation and discovery.   This option would also provide confidentialproprietary information to the PUC about how Enron gets its competitiveadvantage.3. TURN OVER DATA FOR OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND LET PUC GET REST OFDATA FROM ISO AND PX. We have told the PUC we do not want to duplicate the efforts of ISOand PX so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give  only missingdata. PRO:  It would be easier and quicker to just give the outside ofCalifornia data and would sidestep for the moment the ongoing jurisdictional question.  Con:  Without Enroncost data for the California ISO and PX transactions, the PUC would not be able to arrive at what they want -- a profit and losspicture.  We would have a hard time representing to the PUC that  thecombination of the PUC data and the Enron data would be all that they needto calculate the answers to Request Nos. 7-10.4. TURN OVER EVERYTHING BUT PRICE This option would simple omit the price data.  Pro:  It would notreveal the profit and loss information.  Con:  It would not reveal theprofit and loss information.  In other words, the PUC is clear that this iswhat they are after.  By giving them everything else, we would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit andloss.  Moreover, by piecing some of it together with the ISO and PXdata, the PUC might be able to put together a revenue picture which will bequite large, but just not the cost or expense side.5. DECLINE TO PRODUCE THE DATA We would tell Harvey Morris that Enron has reconsidered its positionfor the following reasons:  (1) Our firm belief that the PUC is  notentitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking; (2) in his latestemail, Harvey has made it clear that the PUC wants more  data (1999)than we discussed earlier; (3) continued threat that if they do not like thetransaction data they will come back and  ask for profit and lossinformation that we do not believe they are entitled to; (4) CommissionerWood s statement that the purpose  of this investigation is to getmoney from market participants in the hands of consumers; (5) investigationby the AG into activities  of other market participants and the noticethat other governmental agencies are cooperating -- who are we producingthis  information to and for what purpose; (6) Enron favors publicdisclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required todo so; (7) Enron is a small player in this market and many other marketparticipants are not involved in the process BPA etc.    PRO:  Thismay be the only way to preserve Enron s challenge to the jurisdiction of thePUC to get this data.  Moreover, in the  current politicalenvironment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked.  Italso makes sense to see what FERC  will do with their published 11/1/00report on investigation date. Under this option, we file our formalobjections and sit back and  wait.6. ME TOO Upon reflection, we agree with the approach taken by the othermarket participants.  We will not produce until the protective order  ismodified and then only data that is within the PUC jurisdiction.  PRO:  Thismakes it look like all the market participants are  acting in concertand really is no different than option 1 above.  Moreover, if you readReliant s responses, they appear ready to  turn over financial data ifthe protective order is modified. (Terry and Mike Day are both out of theiroffices today.)  Note that  Williams is adopting a strategy that saysthe PUC needs to go to Superior Court to enforce its subpoena.  This may bemet with  strong opposition by the PUC given their Californiaconstitutional contempt authority.7. MOVE TO QUASH BEFORE THE ALJ Here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why thePUC does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits  before theALJ.  PRO:  The ALJ is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions.  Ithas the least procedural risks of being  dismissed.  CON:  Readingthe tea leaves, we believe it unlikely that the ALJ will determine that thePUC has no jurisdiction. Moreover, because the PUC has its own constitutionally grantedcontempt power, the PUC will take the view (according to Mike  Day) thatthey need not go to the Superior Court for enforcement.  They will also takethe view that the Superior Court has no  jurisdiction  to hear ourappeal.  Appeals have to go to the PUC and those orders are appealable atthe Court of Appeal level.   Thus, the only de novo review of ourobjections might be at the ALJ level.8. FILE DECLARATORY RELIEF ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA We would claim federal question jurisdiction under the Federal PowerAct and in particular the provisions of 824(g) under which the PUCissued its subpoena in part.  The dispute to be decided is whether the PUChas the jurisdiction to seek the profit and  loss information from thewholesale market.  The authority for this would be Mississippi Power & Lightv. Mississippi  487 US  354 (bright line between wholesale market regulatedby FERC and the retail market regulated by states); Bristol Energy Corp v.New Hampshire 13 F.3d 471 (1st Cir. 1994)(federal question whether stateagency can inquire into business and financial data  in the wholesalemarket but found no cognizable claim.)  PRO:  The federal forum may be moreeven handed than the ALJ, but  the question is whether we can state acognizable claim.  There may be greater protections from disclosure of theinformation as  well.  CON:  The PUC may continue on a parallel track unlesswe are able to obtain injunctive relief.  The PUC might seek  discovery ofthe same information in the Federal court proceeding.  We should assume thatthis action will trigger the strongest  response from the PUC and/or the AGin form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the sameinformation (e.g  unfair business practice suit, price gouging,anti-trust etc.).   We should anticipate deposition requests for tradersetc.  By taking  this position, we will clearly be conceding that ifFERC asks for the data it is germane to their authority.9. SEPARATE RESPONSES/STRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT ENRON ENTITIES It may make some sense to chart a different course for PortlandGeneral, EES and EEMC and continue to produce some data from  thoseentities.  PRO:  The information provided for these entities is not likelyto generate profit and loss information that would be  germane to the fightwe are about to engage in (e.g. EES s description of % off tariff rates forexample.)  For Portland General,  Dave Aamodt is out of the office andnot able to participate in any change of direction discussions.Hope this is helpful.ThanksGary=======================================================This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

The Democrats would not support any extenders bill as leverage to get a Stimulus Package passed and everything died.  The Speaker has asked the President to call Congress back on Jan 2 to debate the Stimulus Package, but that seems unlikely. The best we can now hope for is that Congress takes up PTC either as part of the Stimulus Package or an Energy Bill in Feb/March  02.  For the wind co, this is good and bad.  The good is that while the Enron BK has kept customers away, at least now none of our competitors can book orders either.  My hope is that PTC extension and the announcement of a new owner for EW will happen about the same time.  The bad news is that it means our US business will be further hurt - a 200 unit  02 is now out of reach and a 100-125 unit year may be the best we can hope for (assuming the PTC is extended in Q1).  (Maybe the Candover folks knew something we didn t, although I doubt it).  For sale purposes, we will run our  02 numbers at 150 units and put as positive a spin on it for bidders as we can.  Bottom line is that  02 will be a break-even to small profit year for us in the US.Stan - we are in the process of revising our financial projections for a teaser to be sent out to bidders next week and this news will be reflected in those projections (meaning that the sale projections will now differ slightly from what we submitted to Enron earlier this week).  Also, we have launched reductions in force in the US.  I will reduce our MFG workforce by around 85 right after the first of the year and expect to have to let another 100-150 go early in Q1.

"Attached is a revised draft of the Price Posting Agreement for your review.  Because text has been rearranged and several provisions have been substantially reworded, the version of this agreement marked against the prior version is not particularly helpful, but I am happy to provide one if you wish.  Please note that I am the only one on the Enron working group that has seen this revised draft; it therefore remains subject to comments by the other members of the team.  Instead of providing a redline, I thought it would be helpful to review the most substantive changes in this e-mail.  Please feel free to give me a call with any comments or questions.1. As I have discussed with Stephen, you should not assume that we have rejected any of your comments if they did not appear in the attached version.   Please contact me to discuss, or resend, any comments that you believe that we accepted but that are not reflected in this document.2. Several new defined terms have been added.  Several definitions were revised to reflect that eSpeed will be posting prices to a platform operated by a separate legal entity that eSpeed will not necessarily control.3. The defined terms ""Sponsor Material Adverse Effect"", ""Sponsor Regulatory Event"", and ""Sponsor Technological Failure"" have been renamed ""eSpeed ..."" instead of ""Sponsor ...""4. Sections 3(a) and (b) have been slightly reworded to reflect the multiple platform concept.   Section 3(c) was moved from Section 5.  The standards for a party s right to suspend have been revised slightly.  Also, Section 4(d) includes a right by Enron to suspend prices specifically in the event of mapping errors; this provision also relates to the termination right in Section 13 with respect to mapping errors. 5. Section 4 has been rewritten to reflect the multiple platforms.     6. Section 5(b) has been revised to reflect that the parties should develop a set of ground rules for operating and maintaining the Interfaces that will govern the parties once they commence operations.7. Section 6 has not been changed in any significant manner, except for Section 6(d) with respect to commissions8. Section 7 has been moved (it was previously Section 9) and reflects our concerns that the means by which contracts are entered into with Enron are clearly disclosed to Participants.9. The parity section has been revised as we discussed -- essentially, Enron shall use ""commercially reasonable efforts to ensure parity""  10. The reps and warranties and covenants have not been substantively revised, but separate reps, warranties and covenants are made by each party (instead of including both parties reps/warranties/covenants in the same provision).11. Section 12 is new.  We felt that the Agreement did not clearly set forth what would have to be done before the parties could start posting prices.12. We have revised Section 13(a)(i) and (iii) and 13(b)(i) and (iii) (termination events as we discussed); 13(a)(ii) and (b)(ii) are new. 13. Section 14 has been substantially revised, but is still confusing,  However, the idea is that the agreement include a single provision governing confidentiality and that certain information that Enron is particularly sensitive about will be kept confidential, while other information becomes eSpeed s property at some point to do with as it wishes.  Any thoughts about clarifying Section 14 would be appreciated.14. The Indemnity has been revised to include a separate section for each party ((a) and (b)), but we do not believe that the substance of the prior provision was changed.15. We need to give further thought to Section 16 and the provisions that eSpeed provided to us (Sections 15(e), (f) and (g) in the prior draft).  While I have discussed this with Stephen and do not object to the point that those provisions is trying to make, the language is a bit broad in places and we need to spend more time with it to make sure that it does not conflict with other provisions of the Agreement.16. I have tried to reserve the right for the parties to obtain injunctive relief, but this section needs expansion -- and I think Stephen had some specific thoughts about what would not be subject to arbitration.17. The Enron Covenant added as Exhibit H is not perfect, but it is essentially what we had contemplated providing.  The Schedule A listing Specified Products is also attached.  Therefore, the only Exhibit or Schedule missing is Exhibit I, which is the commission structure. Please feel free to call or send a message if you have any comments or questions regarding the atttached.

ExxonMobil, Shell,==20and Chevron have all missed output targets, despite the incentive of two=20years of high oil prices. ExxonMobil planned a 3% annual growth target last==20year but its output for the second quarter of 2001 was flat versus a year==20ago. Shell reported that its 2nd quarter production increased by only 1%,==20well short of the 5% target. Depletion from existing oil fields runs at an==20average rate of about 5% per year, and that has to be replaced by an=20equivalent amount of new production just to keep output steady. From 1998 t=o=202000 the six biggest publicly traded companies largely failed to replace th=e=20oil and natural gas they produced with new reserves, after stripping out th=e=20effect of acquisitions and revisions, according to Andersen management=20consulting. BP posted one of the best performances, replacing 200% of its==20natural gas production and 86% of its oil. Shell replaced only 42% of its==20natural gas and 55% of its oil, according to Andersen. BP has set the most==20ambitious production growth target of 5.5% for this year up 7% for the long=er=20term.=20From http://www.enerfax.com (Sunday, August 19, 2001):=20Natural Gas Futures Dip Lower    Natural gas futures for September delivery on the NYMEX dipped $0.064 l=ower Friday to $3.303 per MMBtu as traders squared short positions now that= Tropical Storm Chantal will miss the GulfCoast. The October contract lost =$0.081 to $3.334 per MMBtu. Tropical Storm Chantal will affect the YucatanP=eninsulaearly this week and then move into the central Gulf but is a noneve=nt. Some traders wanted their positions cleared in preparation for next wee=k s AGA storage report as they do not trust last week s reported build of j=ust 3 Bcf, and believe that the AGA may report a higher build this week to =compensate. A lot of traders got burned by last week s report and are begin=ning to doubt the whole system. But, others look at the data as just a one-=week blip brought about by a crescendo of events that no longer exist and d=o represent not a long-term shift. However, if Wednesday s AGA injection is= low again this week, look for the market to rally to a higher level, but i=n the meantime it will be controlled by the storm entering the Gulf of Mexi=co. Look for support in the $3.15-$3.20 range and again at $3.00. Resistanc=e is pegged at $3.40 and again around $3.60. Natural gas for next day deliv=ery across the USand Canadawas generally $0.10 - $0.20 lower Friday.

An open season for ca=pacity on the Gulf Pines Pipeline is being currently being held. Gulf South= Pipeline, formerly Koch Gateway Pipeline, is owned by Entergy-Koch. If com=pleted, Gulf Pines would be 600 - 700 miles long, and would extend through =Georgia, South Carolinaand North Carolina. Anticipating an in-service date =of summer 2004, Gulf South is soliciting binding and non-binding bids for c=apacity on Gulf Pines through September 19th. The pipeline would offer an i=nterconnection with Gulf South near MobileBay, allowing customers to source= supply from Texasand Louisianaas well as from MobileBay. The Gulf South sy=stem also offers links to major storage and supply hubs.=20Gas Daily reports this proposed pipeline may have a capacity of 1 bcf per d=ay.  It also gives the following website for additional information:  http:=//www.gulfpinespipeline.com .=20Natural Gas Market Ponders Storage Report =20    While some were questioning the accuracy of this week s astonishingly l=ow natural gas storage report, others blamed Tropical Storm Barry and highe=r demands from new power generation load. However, both the futures and cas=h markets jumped. Futures closed up $0.374 the day the report was announced=, and the cash market rose $0.20 - $0.40 the day after. Some chose to not b=elieve the 3 Bcf storage fill reported by the AGA, chalking it up to bad da=ta. The average amount injected during a week in August is over 60 Bcf. The= prior week s fill was 80 Bcf. Factoring in Barry and the prolonged heat wa=ve that week, the market had been expecting a somewhat lower number, but al=l had predicted something above 50 Bcf. There are various reports and theor=ies. Buyers for northeastern utilities said they had all injected and were =shocked by the minus 12 Bcf storage number reported for the East. They coul=d not entirely dismiss it, however. They noted that in the last 4 years all= the new plants that have been built are natural gas only facilities. Last =week could have been a good indication of what that could mean to the marke=t. The AGA says they checked and re-checked when they came up with the unbe=lievable number. The AGA s numbers have always lined up with the more exten=sive EIA reports. It is possible that a number of factors came together all= at once, with the impact of Barry on production and an higher generation l=oads because of Eastern heat wave. However, the curve in the cash market ha=s been going down. That may mean that if there is a market opportunity to m=ove volumes from storage to a consumer right now, that could be done, assum=ing 4 or 5 weeks later it could be replaced at the same price or maybe even= less. Also, there is speculation that the pipelines were re-packing their =lines with volumes out of storage because of a sudden draw down.=20Ziff Energy Group to Hold Conference In Portland=20Current Realities, Future ExpectationsPacific NorthwestGas Strategies ConferenceOctober 2,2001Portland,Oregon(at the Hilton Portland)Hear Commissioner Wilson Condon, State of Alaska, describe how Alaskagas su=pply will energize the Pacific Northwestsupply portfolio.

The Senate Republicansagreed late this week to oppose SB 28x (Sher), which makes severalIEP-sponsored proposals to the siting process, due to a controversialprovision added in the Assembly Appropriations Committee regardingunemployment compensation.  Assembly Republicans let it slide on processbecause CMTA and the Chamber s objections to the egregious language was solast minute.  Senate Republicans had more time to look at the issue andagreed not to let it go forward.  Since they control of the final vote in abill requiring two-thirds, their united opposition stopped the bill, onevote shy.  The author was granted reconsideration and discussions will beon-going over the next week on how to proceed.  The best-case scenario atthis point is getting one Republican to drop from the ranks.  Worst-casescenario is the bill dies, and our language gets picked up in anothervehicle starting the whole process all over again.  The more likelyscenario, however, lies somewhere in between.  Parties will agree to somecompromise language, send the bill back to the Assembly to make theappropriate changes, then bring it back to the Senate for a clean vote.-- Long-term contracting was moved to the front burner this week by Asm.Wright (AB 57) and Senator Morrow (SB 997), both with different results.Both measures, which are almost identical, set forth a criteria which, iffollowed by an IOU when signing a long-term contract with an energysupplier, would eliminate the need for a reasonableness review by the CPUC.AB 57 passed out of the Assembly Utilities and Commerce committee withlittle discussion and a few technical amendments.  SB 997 faced a longer,more difficult hearing in front of Senator Bowen s Energy Committee.  IEP,along with the three IOUs testified in support of the measure, while TURNexpressed great concerns with the concept of leaving the CPUC out of thepicture.  In the end, the Senate committee agreed to put the bill off forfurther discussions, passed a motion in support of getting the appropriaterule waver so the bill can be heard again after Friday s policy committeedeadline, and scheduled a stakeholder meeting for Thursday morning.  SenatorBurton announced on the Senate Floor Thursday morning, however, that allrequests for rule wavers would be denied.  AB 57 appears to be the onlyactive vehicle on this issue, and IEP will be at the negotiating tableproviding input on the language as it moves forward.-- AB 60x is scheduled for hearing next week in the Senate Energy Committee.IEP met with committee staff this week, which revealed some possiblelatitude in amending the bill.  IEP and other member company lobbyists willbe pushing hard for an opposed position from the rest of the committeebefore the hearing Tuesday afternoon.  At this time, however, we do not haveany alternative language for the bill.  After further review by some IEPmember companies, the previously drafted amendments appear unworkable andwere withdrawn from consideration.  We anticipate on waiting to see wherethe committee on Tuesday takes the issue before another attempt at draftingalternative language.-- SB 1x (Soto/Scott) was amended this week before its hearing in the SenateAppropriations committee next week.  The new language finds a backdoor tothe price cap issue by imposing a 100 percent tax on the sale of electricpower that exceeds a base price of $80 per MW/hr.  CMTA, the Chamber andCalTax will be coordinating strategy for the hearing with IEP and thegenerators, but despite the bill s multiple constitutional and legalproblems, most admit the measure will move forward with little trouble.  Anew player on the scene will probably provide the most noteworthy testimony.InterGen North America, which is developing a 900 MW power plant in PalmSprings, plans on testifying that if this measure is signed by the Governor,they will absolutely pull the project and go to Oklahoma.-- Newly amended this week is AB 67x (Cardoza), which now makes it a felonyfor a corporation that sells electricity or natural gas at unjust orunreasonable rates. Sponsored by Lt. Governor Bustamante, the measureestablishes stiff fines and possible jail time, that could be subject to thestate s ""three strikes"" law.  AB 67x has already generated opposition fromRepublicans and constitutional questions from legal experts.   AlthoughCardoza noted that several aspects of the bill are unresolved and couldchange, the intent will remain the same, and he insists that energycompanies that take advantage of Californians will still face significantpenalties.-- SB 6x, (Burton), which establishes a State Power Authority, passed theAssembly this week by a 48 to 28 vote.  The measure needs the Senate toconcur on the Assembly amendments before it heads to the Governor s desk.-- Attached are the most recent legislative tracking reports for both thespecial and regular sessions.

"HEADLINE: ?Calif. Governor To Address StateBYLINE: JENNIFER COLEMANDATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.BODY:???While Gov. Gray Davis prepared to speak to the state Thursday night aboutCalifornia s energy crisis, economic forecasters predicted the power crunchwould lead to higher taxes and scrapped public projects.??Davis said Wednesday he hadn t written his five-minute address, but that heplanned to discuss   the progress that we ve made and what we have to getthrough.  ??Among other things, he was expected to talk about the more than 40 percentrate increases approved last week by the Public Utilities Commission forcustomers of the state s two largest utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. andSouthern California Edison Co. He has asked California television stations tocarry his remarks live.??California has been hit with rolling blackouts and tight power suppliesblamed in part on soaring wholesale electricity costs.??On Wednesday, the state got more bad economic news: The UCLA AndersonBusiness Forecast said Californians would face higher taxes and a tighter statebudget because of the billions of state dollars being spent on emergency power.The blackouts and the state s scrutiny of private power suppliers also threatento scare away new businesses, the report said.??Facing continued refusal from federal energy regulators to cap high energyprices, Davis said Wednesday he would be willing to support a windfall-profitstax on electric generators that have made a fortune selling power to Californiathis year.??A bill to that effect was introduced Wednesday in the state Assembly. Itwould tax gross receipts that   significantly exceed   the cost of producingpower and tax profits of power marketers who have bought power and later sold itat much higher rates.??  We continue to allow some electricity generators and middlemen to reapenormous profits on their sales of electricity into the state. This profiteeringmust stop,   Democratic Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett said.??Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said he doubted a tax on a selectedindustry would be legal. He added that such a tax would discourage generatorsfrom building new power plants in California.??  The governor has made very clear that he is trying to do whatever he can toincrease the amount of generation in California and reduce the price.Windfall-profits taxes do neither of these,   Williams said.??Davis said he generally opposes treating profitable companies in that manner,  but these profits are outrageous and are at our expense. The only thingscompanies understand is leverage.  ??For the first time, Davis also said the state should let companies buy theirpower from generators instead of going through the utilities.??The Utility Reform Network and the head of the PUC oppose the idea. Theyargue residential customers and small businesses unable to contract withgenerators would get stuck with the bill for the billions of dollars the statehas and will spend buying electricity for the customers of the cash-strappedutilities.HEADLINE:  Chaos  in state electricity planningBYLINE: By Rick JurgensBODY:??LOS ANGELES _ Two hundred of the finest economic minds in California gatheredWednesday at UCLA s Anderson School of Management to discuss the state s energycrisis but, as state Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch spoke,the power to her microphone cut out intermittently and unexpectedly.??""I don t have any control over this,"" the beleaguered technician operatingthe sound system called out after repeated outages.??""I feel your pain,"" Lynch replied with a smile.??No one in the audience doubted that. After two rounds of rolling blackoutsthat state officials were powerless to prevent, Lynch last week led thecommission to hike retail power rates 42 percent, sparking protests fromconsumer groups.??But at UCLA Lynch had power and natural gas producers in her sights. Shepromised to lead ""a war against the sellers who are taking so much value out ofthe California economy and not adding a whit of value.""??Lynch said she favored reinstatement of wholesale price caps that were endedby the Federal Energy Rate Commission in December but wasn t counting on that.??Even without those caps, she said she was optimistic that the state hadenough tools to restrain price hikes by wholesalers and avoid another rate hike.??Those tools include conservation, purchases of long-term power contracts bythe Department of Water Resources, utility cost cutting and making sure thesmall power producers known as qualifying facilities are online, she said.??Lynch dismissed the state s 1996 deregulation plan as a ""failed experiment""and said she did not accept a questioner s premise that ""true deregulation isour goal."" The problem was that ""the state stepped back too much"" frommanagement of the power system and that there had been ""too much ideology andtheory and not enough practical solutions,"" she added.??A panel of experts offered some grim predictions. ""We are expecting severedifficulties for this summer and next summer,"" said Barry Sedlik, a SouthernCalifornia Edison manager.??Mark Bernstein, an analyst with the Rand Corp. in Santa Monica, said theelectricity problems are spreading. ""This may go on for a while and it s notjust California,"" he said. ""In the near term we ve got chaos,"" he added.??But he offered one macabre ray of hope. He said that federal policymakers may feel more urgency to step in if, as now appears possible, rolling blackouts occur in 2002 in Florida where, he didn t need to add, President Bush s brother is governor.??Problems with the transmission system there, as well as generation shortage,could hurt Florida but the state has enough time to avoid a crisis, he said inan interview.",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False

If it is, then whatobligation does NCNG have with respect to the construction of a deliverypoint.  I haven t reviewed the annexation statutes yet, but based on myinitial reading of the Service Area Territory Agreement between Rocky Mountand NCNG, once annexed the site would come within Rocky Mount s purview toserve, and, although a ""mutually agreeable"" delivery point would have to benegotiated, NCNG would at least have to negotiate that in good faith.The January 13, 1992 Service Area Territory Agreement gives Rocky Mount theright to distribute natural gas within the city s incorporated limits aswell as a specified area outside the incorporated limits.   The contractgoes on to provide that should any part of that perimeter be annexed intothe city, ""the respective rights of the parties as to service in any suchportion shall be determined by applicable case law and the General Statutesof North Carolina. . .""  The contract further provides that absent an orderof the NCUC to the contrary, NCNG agrees that Rocky Mount has the right toserve all end users within the ""aforementioned"" area--presumably referringto the annexed area, although the agreement is not a model of clarity.So, at least based on this language, Rocky Mount s right to serve arguablytracks its incorporated limits, whatever they might be.  (Jonathan and Iarelooking at annexation law to see what else might be lurking out there).The 1992 Service agreement provides, In Article IV, provides that points ofdevliery for all natural gas purchased or transported under the agreementwith NCNG shall be ""at the following locations and other stations added atmutually agreeable locations in the future. . ."" In the Third Amendment tothe Natural Gas Service Agreement, dated March 10, 1997, new language anddelivery points are negotiated upon, but the principle is still includedthat  other stations may be added at ""mutually agreeable locations in thefuture.""  The question which then arises is what Rocky Mount would have togive in exchange.

"X-FileName: andy zipper 6-26-02.PSTTo summarize where we are on the accounting issues related to booking all of the income related to our 12.5% equity investment in Kiodex in Q1:The 12.5% equity investment has to be a completely separate transaction from the co-marketing arrangement for which we are paid in warrants.Kiodex cannot clawback or redeem any portion of the 12.5% if Enron walks the co-marketing agreement at any point in the five-year term.  It is ours to keep.The 12.5% equity investment will be collapsed with the co-marketing deal (and therefore income can only be realized over the five-year term) if there isn t enough consideration for the 12.5% to make it look like a real deal.  Mike Patrick believes that we can get the desired accounting treatment for the 12.5% if we deliver promotional materials to our customers and EnronOnline ""statistics"" as consideration for the 12.5%.  We have not really spelled out exactly what this consideration is, but I have attached a draft stock purchase agreement in which we have attempted to do so in Section 5.11.Kiodex wants to close this deal by March 7; we probably can t get the consideration in line by then, but we probably could by the end of the quarter.  Kiodex wasn t crazy about giving us the 12.5% for anything less than the 5-year marketing agreement, and wanted a clawback on the shares even then; they sure won t give us 12.5% for a promise to deliver the consideration by the end of March.  This means we will have to close the deal into escrow, and can get the shares when we deliver the consideration.Here are the questions for the deal team:1.	  What can we give to Kiodex before the end of Q1 that supports our 12.5% equity investment.  I can describe the promotional materials, but what ""statistics"" can we provide that will be valuable to Kiodex?  (Remember that Kiodex will have to feel like they are getting SOMETHING for the 12.5% equity they are giving us, because again, it will be ours to keep regardless of what happens to the co-marketing agreement).2.	 Whatever we decide to give to Kiodex for the 12.5%, we will have to be able to deliver it IN FULL by the end of Q1; otherwise, we can t get our shares, and we can t book the income.Here is the stock purchase agreement; I wam working on the language in Section 5.11, but it gives you an idea of what we think we might be able to do.

Inevitably, we have to fight hard for these ""concessions"" in our negotiations and end up leaving a lot of Enron consideration (not to mention blood and sweat) on the table to get these provisions inserted in our contracts.  If we are really being ""taken"" by these crafty Brazilian lawyers (like the former General Counsel of the Odebrecht Group), I think we should re-think the policy in this specific instance.Elektro, because it is the fifth largest electricity LDC in Brazil, has a long history of litigation in the Sao Paulo courts (we had a number of cases, you will recall, when we bought it, and have had others since). It is clearly not the only substantial, high-profile Brazilian company Enron has down here, making it a little hard for us to negotiate these provisions as ""foreigners""  the way we do elsewhere.  By all means we should check with Jose Emilio, but if he shares Sami s (and, I have to say, my) concerns, I think we should consider making a special rule for Brazil-to-Brazil contracting transactions.  Perhaps we could have the first position be ICC arbitration in Sao Paulo (in English?), with a forum savings clause that states that if the arbitration provision is held unenforceable that the litigation will be in the courts (federal, if possible) of Sao Paulo.  The worst thing that could happen is that we enter into an arbitration provision, thinking we are safe, and end up in some court in a smaller city in a backwater part of Brazil where they are a little loose on the law and perhaps even looser on the concepts of justice, due process, etc.If you would like me to be involved in the further discussions, let me know.RandySami Arap01/10/2001 06:20 AMTo: Robert C Williams/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Michelle Blaine/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, margalith@elektro.com.br, Randy Young@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Rob Walls@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Re: Elektro s telecom project  Thanks again, Bob.I will call Jos, Emilio to check.  I agree that a foreign arbitral award is enforceable in Brazil (whether international or local aspects are under discussion) provided that you follow the ""exequatur"" procedure at the Brazilian Supreme Court.  I have personally participated in the enforcement of a foreign arbital award against Odebrecht a few years ago.However, the point I am raising is that in case one of the two Brazilian contracting entities challenge such foreign arbitration clause and refer the matter under dispute to a local court, it is most likely that the Brazilian judge will accept jurisdiction and review the case, in accordance with Article 88 (I)(II)(III) of the Brazilian Civil Procedure Code.  In such event, if Enron (please note that I am always & only referring to an Enron Brazilian entity) agrees to a foreign arbitration clause with a Brazilian counterparty, it may end up resolving its contractual disputes at the Brazilian courts (and this is exactly what I am trying to avoid by suggesting ICC arbitration in S?o Paulo for all contracts entered into between two Brazilian entities).Even if the two Brazilian contracting entities refer the matter under dispute to foreign arbitration and, at the same time or at a later stage, one of the parties decide to challenge the foreign arbitration clause and refer the matter to the local courts, it is most likely that the Brazilian Supreme Court will recognize the local courts jurisdiction and decide that the foreign arbitration clause was null and void.I will be in Houston on Friday, January 26, and would very much appreciate the opportunity to discuss this matter in detail with you and possibly with Rob Walls and/or Jim Derrick.Regards,SamiRobert C Williams@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT01/09/2001 10:18 PMTo: Sami Arap/SA/Enron@ENRONcc: Michelle Blaine/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, margalith@elektro.com.br@ENRON, Randy Young, Rob Walls Subject: Re: Elektro s telecom project  Sami,I agree on the issue of Brazilian law.  But on the question of foreign arbitration, our advice has been that such a clause will be enforced by the local courts, even if the dispute has no international aspects other than the parent is foreign (although there was a dissenting opinion from one lawyer on this issue).   Could you check this point with Jose Emilio Pinto at Tozzini or Fernando Serec?  As to local arbitration, we have accepted this where the dollar amount of the disputes is likely to be less than $500,000.  We should probably also have a cumulative cap of, say, $5 million.   On bigger deals, Rob orJim have resisted local court jurisdiction.  The most flexible they have been to my knowledge where more $ is at stake is to agree to ICC-administered arbitration in Sao Paulo.  In this case, I think we should propose the local arbitration procedure which would is best calculated to result in an impartial award, whether that be ad hoc, ICC, FIESP, or Canadian-Brazilian C of C.  Jose Emilio would have a view on this, too.  Hope this is helpful.Bob  Sami Arap@ENRON01/09/2001 04:48 PMTo: Michelle Blaine/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Robert C Williams/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: margalith@elektro.com.br Subject: Re: Elektro s telecom project  	Michelle and Bob;Thanks for the reply.  The issue here is when Brazilian entities (only) are entering into a contract which obligations will only be performed in Brazil and such agreement is governed by Brazilian laws.  My understanding of the Enron arbitration policy (and please correct me if I am wrong) is that when Enron (as a foreign company) is dealing with foreign governments, governmental agencies or government-owned companies, or private companies from the host company, we must follow our internal policy by choosing preferred arbitration rules, preferred place of arbitration and preferred governing law.In case of Elektro, as well as any other Brazilian Enron entity (EAS, ECE etc), entering into a contract with another Brazilian party with obligations to be performed in Brazil, such contract will most likely be governed by Brazilian laws.  Although the parties are in principle able to select a foreign law in Brazil, the contracting parties must comply with local public policy.  I strongly advise that two or more Brazilian parties contracting obligations in Brazil agree that the respective contract be governed by the laws of Brazil.With respect to the dispute resolution mechanism, we are all aware of Enron s policy to avoid referring disputes to the Brazilian courts.  In case of the above mentioned Elektro deal, the idea is to submit all contract controversies to arbitration under ICC rules in S?o Paulo.  To me, the question is whether we use ""ad hoc"" arbitration OR institutional arbitration (i.e. submit the matter to FIESP or the Canadian-Brazilian Chamber of Commerce to act as the ""arbitration administrator"").FYI since I joined Enron, I ve been told that all of Enron s Brazilian entities should use foreign arbitration as their contracts  dispute resolution mechanism.  In my opinion, this concept may not work the way Enron wants.  If the local Enron entity is dealing with another Brazilian party and (suppose) both parties have agreed to use ICC arbitration in NY, it is most likely that, in case the Brazilian counterparty decides to refer the matter under dispute to the Brazilian courts, the local judge will accept jurisdiction and review the case.  You may ask ""why"".  The reason is because there are two Brazilian parties contracting obligations to be performed in Brazil under the laws of Brazil; as a consequence a local judge will accept jurisdiction.I d very much like to emphasize that, while working as General Counsel of the Odebrecht Group, I use to accept foreign arbitration clauses in contracts entered with Affiliates of foreign companies because I knew that, at the end of the day, I could always challenge the dispute resolution mechanism agreed in the contract and refer the matter to the local courts.  Since Odebrecht s counterparties did not do their homework properly ...Arbitration was first introduced in Brazil through the Federal Constitution of 1824.  The Civil Code of 1916 ractified the use of arbitration, however, it obliged the arbitral award to be reviewed by the local courts.  Only in 1996, with the issuance of the Brazilian Arbitration Act (Law 9307), it was recognized the use of arbitration as a definitive dispute resolution mechanism without having to submit the final arbitral award to the review of the local courts.With respect to enforceability, please note that the arbitral award is final, binding and enforceable towards the contracting parties.  Only in case a Party decides not to comply with the final arbital award, the other Party may refer the arbitral award to a local judge to obtain an ""exequatur"".Please feel free to contact me at the earliest possible convenience to continue to discuss this arbitration matter.Rgds,SamiRobert C Williams@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT01/09/2001 03:55 PMTo: Michelle Blaine/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Sami Arap/SA/Enron@ENRON Subject: Re: Elektro s telecom project  There was a concern at one point that FIESP would favor big, ""homegrown"" companies.

The SPC will be named ""SP Telecom"".  SP Telecom will develop telecommunication services using the LDCs  infra-structure.  After SP Telecom s formation, an investor will be selected to purchase the majority of the company s shares.  Elektro will have a 5% participation in SP Telecom and this deal will generate approximately US$10MM in revenues for Elektro.The Parties have been discussing a draft MOU for several months, however, this matter came to my attention only a few weeks ago.  The MOU has been reviewed by all Parties and is currently on final rounds of negotiation.There is one pending issue which I need to discuss with you before I get Jim Derrick s sign-off.  CTEEP and EPTE (state and private owned LDCs) have requested that the MOU, as well as any other SP Telecom project agreement, includes a dispute resolution mechanism through the courts of S?o Paulo.  I have discussed this matter with Jose Margalith (Elektro s in-house counsel) and Randy Young, and have suggest Margalith to offer ICC arbitration at FIESP (the S?o Paulo State Industries Federation) as an alternative.Orlando Gonzalez asked me to assist him to resolve this pending issue at the earliest possible convenience.

"Ken and Jeff:Glen Darden, the President and CEO of Quicksilver Resources, Inc., is a longtime personal and professional friend of mine.  Recently, he has asked whether I would consider serving as an outside Director on the Board of Directors of Quicksilver.  Before meeting with Glen to discuss this further, I want to make sure that Enron does not have any objections.Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, Quicksilver is a natural gas and crude oil production company engaged in the development and acquisition of long-lived producing natural gas and oil properties. Quicksilver began trading publicly in March of 1999 on the American Stock Exchange (KWK).  Quicksilver has a long standing business relationship with Enron.  Enron has historically entered into pre-pays and hedging transactions related to natural gas production and continues to do so today.  Enron (via JEDI) also provided some financing at the time of the merger of Quicksilver and Mercury Exploration and was a significant shareholder of Quicksilver at the time of its initial public offering.  I believe JEDI has since divested this stockholding.If I were to serve on the board of Quicksilver, I expect that there will be related party transactions of a routine ongoing nature that would need to be disclosed and which I would need to abstain from voting on as a member of the board.  However, I do not feel there would be any material conflicts of interest as Quicksilver s core business is complementary to Enron, not competitive with Enron.  As a personal matter, it is an experience that would be beneficial and would provide valuable personal visibility in our industry.I am scheduled to meet with Glen and others at Quicksilver later this month to further discuss this possibility.  Would each of you please let me know after due consideration whether you have any objection to or concern with the position.  Please do not hesitate to call me (x67713) if you have any questions or wish to discuss this further.Thanks.Jim Hughes",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False

I ve also attached a summary of the RD written by Kevin Brocks, our NESPA Counsel.  As you can see, the RD dismisses aggressive migration measures until wholesale markets are functioning better.  Furthermore, the RD states that until supplies increase and markets stabilize, ratepayers must be protected.  In addition, a PSC official is quoted as saying that it ""will be another three to four years until there is sufficient supply in the state to allow for workably competitive markets, and that it could be at least 10 years before retail competition is viable.""

I think the downside is approximately $2 million per unit (given that that is our effective premium being offered today), but that we have a natural hedge on this downside as we have a high chance of recouping any downside by combining the turbines with any of the development assets listed above (they have all been permitted for 7FAs, although not all permits have been received). -----Original Message-----From:  Schneider, Chip  Sent: Friday, June 01, 2001 9:52 AMTo: Jacoby, Ben; Mann, KayCc: Deffner, Joseph; Duran, W.

These are some thoughts: Market monitor should have the ability to monitor the activities of the RTO and the markets.  For example, if the RTO is a transco, it is appropriate for the MM to review whether the RTO is doing something potentially problematic in planning, ATC calcs, etc. MM should only have the ability to recommend changes to market structure, possible penalties, etc.  MM should not have the ability to issue a penalty to any one without first going to FERC.  It is possible that the MM could ask for FERC pre-approval to issue ""penalties"" or remedies for certain conduct.  The example that comes to mind is the $1000 price cap in PJM.  It has been approved at FERC and if someone bids above it, the MM could reduce the bid to $1000 without going to FERC again. MM has no authority that FERC does not have.  (I have heard some (outside of Enron) people state that the MM should have authority to do things that FERC could not do.) Market participants should always retain their right to go to FERC before providing documents in response to an MM request and should retain right to go to FERC even if there is an arbitration clause (should not be required to agree to binding arbitration). Ultimately, FERC staff could provide the MM function. Let me know any comments ASAP please (since I have comments due on this Friday for the SE RTO).

(E-mail)"" <richard.b.sanders@enron.com>		 cc: ""Meringolo, Peter"" <PMeringolo@brobeck.com>		 Subject: Some thoughts on optionsPRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIALATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGERichard, After today s discussion here are our brainstorming ideas onoptions:1.   WAIT FOR A BETTER PROTECTIVE ORDER Ask Harvey Morris where they are on fixing the protective order thatis being litigated by others.  If the protective order has not  changed,then unilaterally postpone production until it is.  Pro: Better protectionand more time; Con: Even with a more stringent protective order Enron still questions whether the PUC is entitledto financial performance data.  Thus, this option does not fullydisclose all of Enron s positions and the company may be accused later ofsimply engaging in delaying tactics.  Under this option  we file ourformal objections as well.2. TURN OVER THE TRANSACTION DATA AS IS Continue on our present course of turning over transaction data forelectricity that was delivered.  Pro: PUC will get the data  anywayeither through FERC, unfair competition, antitrust or price gouginglitigation.  By turning over the data that will show  profits, PUC mightslow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business byseeking to depose witnesses etc.  Con:  This would be waiving thelegitimate question that Enron has as to the PUC s ability to discovery thisinformation through a  subpoena.  There is also a question of howconfidential this data would be given the current political agenda.  Itmight also serve  to whet the appetite of the PUC for more Enroninformation and discovery.   This option would also provide confidentialproprietary information to the PUC about how Enron gets its competitiveadvantage.3. TURN OVER DATA FOR OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND LET PUC GET REST OFDATA FROM ISO AND PX. We have told the PUC we do not want to duplicate the efforts of ISOand PX so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give  only missingdata. PRO:  It would be easier and quicker to just give the outside ofCalifornia data and would sidestep for the moment the ongoing jurisdictional question.  Con:  Without Enroncost data for the California ISO and PX transactions, the PUC would not be able to arrive at what they want -- a profit and losspicture.  We would have a hard time representing to the PUC that  thecombination of the PUC data and the Enron data would be all that they needto calculate the answers to Request Nos. 7-10.4. TURN OVER EVERYTHING BUT PRICE This option would simple omit the price data.  Pro:  It would notreveal the profit and loss information.  Con:  It would not reveal theprofit and loss information.  In other words, the PUC is clear that this iswhat they are after.  By giving them everything else, we would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit andloss.  Moreover, by piecing some of it together with the ISO and PXdata, the PUC might be able to put together a revenue picture which will bequite large, but just not the cost or expense side.5. DECLINE TO PRODUCE THE DATA We would tell Harvey Morris that Enron has reconsidered its positionfor the following reasons:  (1) Our firm belief that the PUC is  notentitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking; (2) in his latestemail, Harvey has made it clear that the PUC wants more  data (1999)than we discussed earlier; (3) continued threat that if they do not like thetransaction data they will come back and  ask for profit and lossinformation that we do not believe they are entitled to; (4) CommissionerWood s statement that the purpose  of this investigation is to getmoney from market participants in the hands of consumers; (5) investigationby the AG into activities  of other market participants and the noticethat other governmental agencies are cooperating -- who are we producingthis  information to and for what purpose; (6) Enron favors publicdisclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required todo so; (7) Enron is a small player in this market and many other marketparticipants are not involved in the process BPA etc.    PRO:  Thismay be the only way to preserve Enron s challenge to the jurisdiction of thePUC to get this data.  Moreover, in the  current politicalenvironment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked.  Italso makes sense to see what FERC  will do with their published 11/1/00report on investigation date. Under this option, we file our formalobjections and sit back and  wait.6. ME TOO Upon reflection, we agree with the approach taken by the othermarket participants.  We will not produce until the protective order  ismodified and then only data that is within the PUC jurisdiction.  PRO:  Thismakes it look like all the market participants are  acting in concertand really is no different than option 1 above.  Moreover, if you readReliant s responses, they appear ready to  turn over financial data ifthe protective order is modified. (Terry and Mike Day are both out of theiroffices today.)  Note that  Williams is adopting a strategy that saysthe PUC needs to go to Superior Court to enforce its subpoena.  This may bemet with  strong opposition by the PUC given their Californiaconstitutional contempt authority.7. MOVE TO QUASH BEFORE THE ALJ Here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why thePUC does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits  before theALJ.  PRO:  The ALJ is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions.  Ithas the least procedural risks of being  dismissed.  CON:  Readingthe tea leaves, we believe it unlikely that the ALJ will determine that thePUC has no jurisdiction. Moreover, because the PUC has its own constitutionally grantedcontempt power, the PUC will take the view (according to Mike  Day) thatthey need not go to the Superior Court for enforcement.  They will also takethe view that the Superior Court has no  jurisdiction  to hear ourappeal.  Appeals have to go to the PUC and those orders are appealable atthe Court of Appeal level.   Thus, the only de novo review of ourobjections might be at the ALJ level.8. FILE DECLARATORY RELIEF ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA We would claim federal question jurisdiction under the Federal PowerAct and in particular the provisions of 824(g) under which the PUCissued its subpoena in part.  The dispute to be decided is whether the PUChas the jurisdiction to seek the profit and  loss information from thewholesale market.  The authority for this would be Mississippi Power & Lightv. Mississippi  487 US  354 (bright line between wholesale market regulatedby FERC and the retail market regulated by states); Bristol Energy Corp v.New Hampshire 13 F.3d 471 (1st Cir. 1994)(federal question whether stateagency can inquire into business and financial data  in the wholesalemarket but found no cognizable claim.)  PRO:  The federal forum may be moreeven handed than the ALJ, but  the question is whether we can state acognizable claim.  There may be greater protections from disclosure of theinformation as  well.  CON:  The PUC may continue on a parallel track unlesswe are able to obtain injunctive relief.  The PUC might seek  discovery ofthe same information in the Federal court proceeding.  We should assume thatthis action will trigger the strongest  response from the PUC and/or the AGin form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the sameinformation (e.g  unfair business practice suit, price gouging,anti-trust etc.).   We should anticipate deposition requests for tradersetc.  By taking  this position, we will clearly be conceding that ifFERC asks for the data it is germane to their authority.9. SEPARATE RESPONSES/STRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT ENRON ENTITIES It may make some sense to chart a different course for PortlandGeneral, EES and EEMC and continue to produce some data from  thoseentities.  PRO:  The information provided for these entities is not likelyto generate profit and loss information that would be  germane to the fightwe are about to engage in (e.g. EES s description of % off tariff rates forexample.)  For Portland General,  Dave Aamodt is out of the office andnot able to participate in any change of direction discussions.Hope this is helpful.ThanksGary=======================================================This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

"John, it s good to hear from you!A few things on your paralegal friend.  First, we don t currently have any openings, though we have tended to hire paralegals with a lot of experience.  Most of the paralegals in our group have about 15-25 years experience.  Also, we recently hired someone, and I don t anticipate us hiring for awhile.Most of Enron s litigation work is done out of Enron Corp.  They do have a big litigation group up there, and that would be the most obvious place to start.  Chuck Cheek is the head lawyer for that group.  You could forward her resume up there with a note, it might get it more personal attention.  Also, keep watching (or she can watch, it online) the job bank, they advertise paralegal jobs there from time to time with all the Enron companies.Another group that might be interested in hiring paralegals, and might hire paralegals with less experience, is the Global Contracts Group headed up by Mary Solmonson.  They re always looking for people, and it might be a good way for your friend to get her foot in the door at ECT.  Also, if her undergraduate degree was in business, obviously, she might have some more options in other groups.As far as running goes, I m trying to get back into shape.  I m just surviving 3 miles around the park, and this weekend I plan to double my mileage to 6.  It sounds like we re both not in fighting form.

It?adopts the Energy Division s program proposals for  load control and distributed generation initiatives and?authorizes a total  of $137.8 million in funding for these programs, on an annual basis through  December 31, 2004.Since the Commission cannot raise electric utility rates until?it  has determined that the rate freeze is over, it has decided to include the costs  of these programs in the utility s distribution revenue requirement, on the  electric side, and defer consideration of an electric rate increase until the  rate freeze ends.? ?The three utilities are directed, within 15 days, to file Advice Letters  increasing their electric distribution revenue requirements, without modifying  current rates, to include the authorized program budgets.? In the interim,  all program costs?are to?be tracked in balancing accounts, and the  utilities should establish such accounts for this purpose.? The utilities  are also?directed to implement these programs, ""without delay.""Under the adopted programs, SDG&E will administer a  demand-responsiveness pilot program, targeted to reach 5,000 residential  customers in its service territory. SCE will administer a similar pilot program,  targeted to 5,000 small commercial customers. SDG&E and SCE will provide  financial incentives to customers who agree to set their thermostats at  pre-specified levels.? Through an internet interface, the utility will  monitor and verify actual interruption of loads at the customer site and provide  interactive information to customers about their electric usage, in order to  encourage peak demand reduction.? Within certain parameters, customers will  have the flexibility to override the thermostat settings, subject to  pre-specified penalties. The draft decision would?also authorize a pilot program to provide  interactive consumption and cost information to small customers, such as  historical energy bill information, representative energy usage and cost  information for common appliances, and tariff options. PG&E?is directed  to?contract with an independent web designer to develop a website that  provides customer online access to this information.??The  Commission s?goal is to reach 10,000 to 15,000 customers in PG&E s  service territory.? The program will be targeted to residential customers  with relatively high monthly energy consumption, residential customers with  swimming pools, homes and small businesses in the San Francisco peninsula or in  Silicon Valley, and/or rural residences and small businesses.The draft decision also proposes to implement a self-generation program  across all the utility service territories.? Under the program, financial  incentives will be provided to distributed generation technologies for amounts  ranging from $1 - $4 per watt and 30-50% of total project cost, depending on the  type of technology used.? There is a table on page 4 of the draft decision  which shows the amounts of the incentives.? The utilities are required to outsource to independent consultants or  contractors all program evaluation activities, and are encouraged to outsource  as many other aspects of program implementation as possible.? All  installation of technologies (hardware and software) at customer sites will be  done by independent contractors, and not utility personnel.? The utilities  are encouraged to coordinate and work closely with local governments,  community-based organizations and business associations to recruit and contact  interested customers.?Dan - 3-15-01 Draft Interim Decision.doc",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False

She will make these and circulate the model later today.  I few items worth mentioning -		1) Capex assumptions still seem too high for 2002-2004.  However, the 2002 number is some $30 million below the ""Dynegy transition"" capex amount shown in the 2002 Capex schedule.  Can we just assume non-discretionary only with the Base Gas repurchase in 2002/2003? Any discretionary would be commercially-driven.		2) Keep O&M flat to 2001 numbers?		3) Tracy / Shelley - Any thoughts on how to incorporate the contract info to better analyze the ""contract roll off"" scenarios? We have just assumed the 2002 Plan with 1-2% growth rate going forward with a new rate case in effect in 2005. Rod, not sure how you want to look at rate case assumptions or expansion opportunities but we can discuss tomorrow.  Recognizing the volume of NNG contract info and the time constraint we are under, there may or may not be any better alternative.		4) Rod - we have assumed an equity infusion of $175 million to re-capitalized NNG to more ""reasonable"" levels.  I can reduce the amount to $112,500,000 which is the Citibank prepay amount allocated to NNG if that sounds reasonable. 		5) We will show a reduction in A/R of $1.807 billion and a corresponding reduction in equity due to the MCTJ loan.		Any thoughts you have on the above items would be very helpful.  We are trying to send out the info memo by the end of the week.  This model will be the basis for the NNG valuation.

She will make these and circulate the model later today.  I few items worth mentioning -1) Capex assumptions still seem too high for 2002-2004.  However, the 2002 number is some $30 million below the ""Dynegy transition"" capex amount shown in the 2002 Capex schedule.  Can we just assume non-discretionary only with the Base Gas repurchase in 2002/2003? Any discretionary would be commercially-driven. [Geaccone, Tracy]  The lower capital is probably from the revised plan.  I am okey with the other assumption. 2) Keep O&M flat to 2001 numbers? [Geaccone, Tracy]  Costs have been reduced due to Dynegy transition.  If we assume under our control, costs would be the same or slightly lower.  I would propose the same for now. 3) Tracy / Shelley - Any thoughts on how to incorporate the contract info to better analyze the ""contract roll off"" scenarios? We have just assumed the 2002 Plan with 1-2% growth rate going forward with a new rate case in effect in 2005. Rod, not sure how you want to look at rate case assumptions or expansion opportunities but we can discuss tomorrow.  Recognizing the volume of NNG contract info and the time constraint we are under, there may or may not be any better alternative. [Geaccone, Tracy]    I think this is a good assumption 4) Rod - we have assumed an equity infusion of $175 million to re-capitalized NNG to more ""reasonable"" levels.  I can reduce the amount to $112,500,000 which is the Citibank prepay amount allocated to NNG if that sounds reasonable. 5) We will show a reduction in A/R of $1.807 billion and a corresponding reduction in equity due to the MCTJ loan.Any thoughts you have on the above items would be very helpful.  We are trying to send out the info memo by the end of the week.  This model will be the basis for the NNG valuation.Thanks,Kevin",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False

My gut reaction is that we will probably need to file the 13D, but it is a routine filing.  I do not know what will be required in terms of hearings in the state process and again request Kay to please advise us on that.It seems to me thay we should get a little farther along before we meet with the team on this, but I defer to your judgment.  Let me know what you want to do.

In my discussions with Audrey, she expressed a hope that Enron would be able to support the filing and that she d like to open a dialogue on how to get our support.  I indicated that there were at least 2 issues that would be of concern for us---support for one RTO and support for one tariff within that RTO.  Although she was open and probably even supportive of one RTO in the midwest, there is a separate tariff for any delivery within the Translink system within her proposal.  SHe described that tariff as being different than the Detroit Edison case that you guys filed against.  I confirmed that the publics who are in the transco (NPPD, OPPD, Cornbelt) would not agree to be in the transco without the separate tariff.I have sent via overnight a copy of materials on the transco to both of you.  I told her that Donna was that lead on the Midwest team, and that you d be willing to talk/meet with her.  If practical, it would be good if you could call her in the next few days for a number of reasons---1.) I am sure that Xcel is planning a similiar transco for the west and if you can get a better sense of whether we are on any of the same pages, it would be good to have that input for our western discussion on Wednesday in Houston  2.) she is one of the panelists for RTO week, so you might be able to set up a time in D.C. that you could meet in person  3.) you might be able to get a sense of what she will be talking about at RTO week on her panel.Here is her info:  		Audrey Zibelman				VIce President				Xcel Energy				Independent Transmission COmpany				414 Nicollet Mall  6th FLoor				Minneapolis, MN  55401				audrey.a.zibelman@xcelenergy.com				#612-330-7713",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman James Hoecker Thursday asked Congress to give the commission new authority to order refunds in the event of electricity price gouging. Hoecker sought the retroactive ratemaking authority in the context of the commission s investigation of power market volatility in California this summer, where prices for San Diego consumers have more than doubled from last year. Congress should give FERC ""authority to retroactively correct extraordinary wealth transfers that can happen when prices unexpectedly skyrocket and consumers cannot get out of the way,"" Hoecker told the House Government Reform Committee. The commission, in response to a petition from San Diego Gas&Electric Co., a unit of Sempra Energy (SRE), has ordered a staff investigation of the market situation in California. FERC will order refunds if it determines that power producers have obtained ""unjust or unreasonable"" prices for the power they sold into California electricity markets overseen by the state s power exchange and independent system operator, Hoecker said. But under the Federal Power Act, FERC can t order any refunds beyond the Aug. 23 date of its order setting the investigation, the nation s chief energy regulator noted. ""We do not now have that authority,"" he said. ""The commission staff is hard at work on completing its fact-finding investigation. Based on the staff report to the commission, we will be prepared to take further measures, as appropriate,"" Hoecker testified. ""The commission expects its actions and the measures adopted by the state will moderate price volatility in California markets,"" he said.

We also understand that the Commission will> be obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here to> duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities.> As you will see in the general documents that are offered here for> production, Enron Energy Services Operations, Inc. is the parent of Enron> Energy Services, Inc. and does not have operating authority or engage in> wholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy.

We propose> that the Commission defer requesting production of other information until> it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant> proportion of their energy into the California market.  At that time a> more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will> be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the> California wholesale market.>> TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS> Requests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19>>  We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for> the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and> PX.  EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of relevant> transaction data for year 2000 (in California and outside of California> and Real Time) for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the> date, counterparty, quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it> is a purchase or a sale.   Because of the speed with which you want this> information, it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or> inaccurate.  For those> transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, we> understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there will> not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide> quickly.  The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to> EPMI s customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading> business.  EES can also provide similar data with respect to relevant> wholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect to> retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail> customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES > confidentiality obligations to those customers.  We anticipate producing> the Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions.>> FERC DOCUMENTS>> Request 20>>  The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received> from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of> those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October> 13, 2000.>>>  Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron> Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on> Friday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities could> make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for> production by then.>>  We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if> any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one> currently in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions> will be protected by the most stringent protective order.

Michael McGarry, from Enron Engineering and Operational Services Company, is the lead Development Engineer on the project.A key question in this effort is, ""Where is the best entry point into the Socal/SG&E/PG&E pipeline systems.  In other words, where can we site a LNG terminal and deliver natural gas into their systems, such that the amount of facilities they require is minimal?  I spoke with Ben Asante who heads up the optimization department in ETS.  He said that if we could get annual flow diagrams for the California intrastate systems, he could prepare a model in about 2 weeks time.  Interstate pipelines have to file Annual Flow Diagrams at FERC, but I m not sure what Intrastates  are obligated to file with the CPUC?  That s where I need your help.  This is a hot subject, because the race to site an LNG terminal is intense.Could you please call me at 713 345 5044 (O) or 713 515 2759 so that we can discuss.

"FYI.Best,Jeff----- Forwarded by Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron on 02/13/2001 10:46 AM -----		CERA: Study Says Long-Term Power Contracts `No Solution   02/12/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Californians will likely see 20 hours of rolling blackouts spread across the state this summer, as short-term solutions to the state s ongoing power crisis come too late, according to a report from the Cambridge Energy Research Associates. CERA, an international energy consulting company, estimates California will be short 5,000 megawatts this summer, which will force the state s independent grid operator to declare some stage of emergency for 200 hours.However, if consumer rates are allowed to increase before summer, Californians will likely cut consumption by 1,500 MW, or one-third of the predicted shortfall, Larry Makovich, a senior director of CERA, said Monday at a press briefing in Houston. A California Public Utilities commissioner agreed with the report. ""It will be bad,"" said Richard Bilas. ""We ve had no additional generating capacity, and until we have price signals, it won t get better.""      CERA experts said long-term steps California must take to create a functioning wholesale market include: establishing a capacity requirement and payment method; streamlining plant siting and approval; resolving the credit crisis the state s utilities face; ending the consumer rate freeze; avoiding tinkering with market rules; creating a positive investment climate, and restructuring the regional transmission grid. In addition, CERA said California utilities should move to portfolio buying over the next three years, rather than contracting long-term supplies now. ""Long-term contracts aren t a solution,"" Makovich said. He added that utilities could contract for huge volumes of power that will be above the market price in as little as 18 months, as natural-gas drilling increases, improving tight gas supply. One of the problems that led California to restructure its power industry was the large amount of power under contract under federal law at above-market prices. With long-term contracts being discussed at $70.00 a megawatt-hour ""we run the risk of creating a bigger problem,"" should natural gas prices retreat over time to around $3.00 a thousand cubic feet, Makovich said. In addition to the obvious move to improve the state s power supply by allowing construction of new generating units, the CERA study urged the state to take several short-term steps to help reduce supply problems this summer, including: expanding load curtailment programs; encouraging conservation; providing flexible emission restrictions; coordinating plant outages on an emergency basis, and providing for flexible hydroelectric facility operations.""The biggest problem is that we are running out of time,"" said Steve Kean, executive vice president at Enron Corp. (ENE), at the briefing on the first day of CERA s five-day energy conference in Houston. While the state Legislature has taken steps to restore the credit situation facing California utilities, the recent disclosure that the Department of Water Resources isn t buying all the power the state needs ""isn t a good way to keep the lights on,"" said Joe Bob Perkins, president of Reliant Energy Inc. s (REI) Wholesale Group, which owns generation in California. He called the credit situation ""increasingly fragile."" And while California s governor and lawmakers stepped in when the two largest California utilities appeared headed for bankruptcy, Bilas said a bankruptcy proceeding might be a way to end rate freezes for California consumers - an unpopular move that other parties have been unwilling to forcefully pursue. ""A bankruptcy judge will say rates have to go up, costs have to be cut,"" Bilas said. ""It s a way to say rates have to go up, but I didn t do it.""    -By Eileen O Grady; Dow Jones Newswires, 713-547-9213;eileen.ogrady@dowjones.com   Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

"Good Morning Sara,I wanted to touch base with you regarding the CSFB 2001 Equity Swap Basket documentation. Since the last time we spoke here are some of the issues discussed along with some additional recommendations.1) Finalizing the Master ISDA Agreement with Credit Suisse First Boston (Europe) Limited. I see that the status is under Credit Review.2) Definitions:	a) Interest Payment Date- should state ""3 business days after the Valuation Date""	b) Reference Price- amend the phrase ""..last regular way trade..."" to state ""...Official Closing Price..."" in (i) and (ii)(b)(iii).	c) Securities- Omit the reference to ""Bonds"". The definition should only read: ""are the securities specified as such in the Confirmation"".	d) Valuation Date (s)- October 15, 2001, November 15, 2001, ... October 15, 2002	3) Section 5.1 (i)- Omit the reference to Bonds. This section (i) should read: ""If a Security pays a dividend or makes another distribution, the payment to be made by the Seller shall be equal to the gross amount of the cash dividend or distribution per share (excluding for the avoidance of doubt any tax credits), as the case may be, multiplied by the Dividend Percentage, multiplied by the Contract Quantity"".We should include a definition for ""Dividend Payment Date"" to read, ""The Equity Payment Date relating to the Valuation Date (s) on which the relevant Dividend Period ends"". We should also include a definition for ""Dividend Amount"". The ""Dividend Amount"" definition should read, ""100% of all ordinary cash dividends where; (i) the ex-dividend date occurs during the period from the day following the Trade Date to and including the final Valuation Date and (ii) the date on which the related ordinary cash dividend would have been received by persons who held the Shares comprising the Basket during such period is during the relevent Dividend Period"".I believe we should address Section 5.2 ""Potential Adjustment Event"". We should recommend replacing the language similar to the Intra-Period Adjustment language we utilitized in the Enron Credit Confirmation. Their section allows CSFB to ""determine"" the provisions of the Intra-Period Adjustments. CSFB should not have control over determining any additonal payment or adjustment of the Opening Price or Contract Quantity. The Intra-Period adjustment language is comprehensive in covering all provisions therein.4) Schedule to Basket Swaps:	a) Applicable Interest Rate Cycle: should read ""1 month""	b) Termination Date: should read ""1 year""	c) Business Day Convention: should be the standard ISDA ""Modified Following Business Day Convention"" language.5) We should also include the Annex structure to be able to monitor the positions held, along with any subsequent adjustments, in the Equity Swap Basket at any time throughout the deal.Please advise if you like to meet to discuss the documentation in further detail.Regards,Jorge A.

"Allyson,As you know, we have had discussions with the City of Rocky Mount regarding possibly buying gas from them for the new power plant in Edgecombe County.

"I met with Jayshree Desai this morning to discuss the recommended changes to the NNG valuation model.  She will make these and circulate the model later today.  I few items worth mentioning -1) Capex assumptions still seem too high for 2002-2004.  However, the 2002 number is some $30 million below the ""Dynegy transition"" capex amount shown in the 2002 Capex schedule.  Can we just assume non-discretionary only with the Base Gas repurchase in 2002/2003? Any discretionary would be commercially-driven.2) Keep O&M flat to 2001 numbers?3) Tracy / Shelley - Any thoughts on how to incorporate the contract info to better analyze the ""contract roll off"" scenarios? We have just assumed the 2002 Plan with 1-2% growth rate going forward with a new rate case in effect in 2005. Rod, not sure how you want to look at rate case assumptions or expansion opportunities but we can discuss tomorrow.  Recognizing the volume of NNG contract info and the time constraint we are under, there may or may not be any better alternative.4) Rod - we have assumed an equity infusion of $175 million to re-capitalized NNG to more ""reasonable"" levels.  I can reduce the amount to $112,500,000 which is the Citibank prepay amount allocated to NNG if that sounds reasonable. 5) We will show a reduction in A/R of $1.807 billion and a corresponding reduction in equity due to the MCTJ loan.Any thoughts you have on the above items would be very helpful.  We are trying to send out the info memo by the end of the week.

Since arbitration is the final stage in the dispute resolution process agreed by the parties and it has been agreed that there should be continuity until any dispute is finally resolved, this position should properly apply to each stage of the dispute resolution process. I suggest that since the dispute resolution procedure envisages continuity, until resolution, that Consumers should continue to invoice on the basis that they have done for the last few years. Richard, we will need your input as to whether we could argue the above with a sufficient degree of confidence to persuade a judge to make an order of specific performance as against Consumers to invoice using the basis that they have been using for the last few years, pending outcome of the dispute resolution process. Further, whether you believe that we will be entitled to seek such equitable relief. We need to take control of this process and ensure that Consumers are always playing catch-up, if we fail to do so we will be playing catch-up and will be out of pocket until the conclusion of the arbitration process. If we do not get Consumers to invoice and pay the sums we believe are due, there will be no incentive on Consumers to start the process and every opportunity for them to delay any resolution of this dispute. I have spoken with Sandy Hollingsworth who will be sending me copies of documents that Dynegy have uncovered which she believes further assist our case. Once I receive them we ought to meet to review and obtain a better understanding of the case we are able to make and the case which may be made against us. Is there any other evidence that we, or Dynegy, should be collecting at this stage, such as interviewing individuals who were involved in the negotiations/discussions with Consumers?

This is a critical issue for EES as we are already long gas behind the gate and we don t need more production.  If the customer can t take my gas from my pool then I will have to bring it in via CNG which will only make my pool longer.2)  If the production meters are moved to EESs  pool then I would suggest just a flat index price between ENA and EES.3)  Will EES be supplying the full 1000/d to the end-user or just the amount of the local production transferred to EESs  pool?  4)  If the fuel credit works the way Chris explains it below then I would be willing to sell all of the gas at index but I will need to confirm that with PNG.To: Chris Germany/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Marde L Driscoll/HOU/EES@EES@ECT, Alain Diza/HOU/EES@EES@ECT, Heidi Griffith/DUB/EES@EES@ECT, Dick Jenkins/HOU/ECT@ECT, Nelson Ferries/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Mary Theresa Franklin/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: Peoples  1.

Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer that can take around 1,000 day.  I don t know if that s dt or mcf.  I will use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.  This customer has a special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the customer pulls.  For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf credited back to your imbalance account the following month.  I don t know how this works with trading imbalances.  But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works out to $.21 - sounds good to me.  Paul said this customer is looking for a CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.  Marde will not sell at that price but I will.Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.  Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, settle up financially with EES and be done with it.  What we could do to test Paul s statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES s pool for July.  It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.

"Heather:Here is an excerpt from a message in which Anita Fam replies to my inquiry:Only 3 types of institutions have the capacity and authority to enter into derivatives transactions in the PRC.  They are:a. banks;b. non-bank financial institutions (""NBFI""); andc. foreign invested enterprises (""FIE"").Banks and NBFIs require banking licences and may only enter into derivative transactions for hedging purposes.  FIEs comprise (i) wholly foreign owned enterprises (""WFOE""); and (ii) sino-foreign owned joint ventures (""SFJV"") and include foreign banks, foreign finance companies and bank branches . There are no specific restrictions for WFOEs but SFJVs may only enter into derivative transactions for hedging purposes as well.    State-owned enterprises and collectively-owned enterprises  can therefore only transact through a duly authorised bank or NBFI.  So it looks as if China National Oil Company (Corp.?) and China State Power Corp. do not have the capacity nor the authority to enter into derivative transactions themselves in the PRC.I have also found a copy of the results of some legal research we had done a year or two ago on these issues.

Two years ago, we agreed to be part of a benchmarking study that was done by AA s Houston office (interestingly enough, Wes Colwell was the AA partner who led this effort) and we had mixed results.  The study was designed to cover gas and power.  Despite our involvement in the steering committee, the study itself was very, very detailed, such that it was troublesome to complete.  Jim Fallon at the time refused to submit information on the majority of the questions surrounding power, so our survey data for power was not very useful.  I would agree that at this time we will pass on this request.  Thanks for passing it along, however.  I would be happy to convey this directly  to the person that has contacted you.  Just let me know his/her name and number and I will follow through on that if you would like.
