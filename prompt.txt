What are the two main e-mail acts in the message? (You can only give one if it's the sole act of the message)
The options are:
- request: A request asks (or orders) the recipient to perform some activity. A question is also considered a request (for delivery of information)
- propose: A propose message proposes a joint activity, i.e., asks the recipient to perform some activity and commits the sender as well, provided the recipient agrees to the request. A typical example is an email suggesting a joint meeting
- commit: A commit message commits the sender to some future course of action, or confirms the sender’s intent to comply with some previously described course of action
- deliver: A deliver message delivers something, e.g., some information, a PowerPoint presentation, the URL of a website, the answer to a question, a message sent “FYI”, or an opinion
- amend: An amend message amends an earlier proposal. Like a proposal, the message involves both a commitment and a request. However, while a proposal is associated with a new task, an amendment is a suggested modification of an already-proposed task
- refuse: A refuse message rejects a meeting/action/task or declines an invitation/ proposal
- greet: A greet message thank someone, congratulate, apologize, greet, or welcomes the recipient(s)
- remind: A reminder message reminds recipients of coming deadline(s) or threats to keep commitment

- ignore: There is no realistic expectation that the recipients will properly read the email, let alone respond to them

- postponed reply: The messages requires a reply but not immediately
