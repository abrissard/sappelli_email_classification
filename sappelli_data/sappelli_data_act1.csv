Mirant and GE have agreed to a closing checklist and fee coverage.Things left to do:1Finalize all documents2.  Receive underwriter approval on the resolution of all insurance claims.3.Agree upon mirror guarantees with Enron and Mission relating to the Union Carbide guarantees.Jeff Donahue informs me that CFSB feels secure that this deal will close on December 15 but not before.  The reason is that there are PPA bids that need to go out by that date.Let s keep daily status reports coming. If I have misrepresented anything in the summary, please let me know."

request,"	Terry, please review and let me know if this sounds OK.  Thanks. Lynn	We met with SoCal today to discuss the changes SoCal is making for	November 1.  Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW:	1.  SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless	     they have operational problems. And they will maintain 750 for a gas 	     day (during all cycles).  (Good news for TW)	2.  SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750.  If they do, they will	     maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there	     are specific operational problems. (Good news for TW)	   	4.  SoCal will have the option to call OFO s at the beginning of each cycle	     for the gas day.  Today they only call an OFO before the gas day begins.	     Starting Nov. 1, they can call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle,	     including Intraday 1 and Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day. (This	     will be a major impact to SoCal s customers)	5.  SoCal says the ""windowing"" is gone.  But, they are still giving us a	     capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations	     exceed their capacity.	6.  SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation.  This	     would be due to SoCal s market not burning their schedule.  At that	     time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn.	Overall, our process does not change. If you have any questions, please	let me know.  Thanks. Lynn"

In the pace of the year-end I forgot to inform you of a piece of litigation commenced by Enron Canada.  The litigation is against NGX Canada Inc. and Canadian Enerdata, and their shareholders, Westcoast Energy and OM Groupen for NGX, and Richard Zarzeczny for Canadian Enerdata.It is somewhat complicated.  In brief, NGX operates an electronic natural gas trading brokerage which suffered competitively after the onset of Enron Online, and Enerdata publishes the only available and reliable natural gas indices for our market.  Traditionally the indices were based upon a comprehensive survey of fixed-price physical gas transactions over the broad market.  Presumably to coerce business onto the NGX system, and with two days  notice, NGX purchased the right to calculate the indices (as opposed to Enerdata itself or the publication itself) and changed the methodology for the indices to include only trades completed on NGX s system.  The result is the indices are, for contractual purposes, quite cleverly unchanged and therefore still as described in hundreds of our trading contracts and thousands of transactions, but in substance have been changed to represent only NGX s segment of the market, which introduces unmanageable volatility and unreliability, and is affected by other limitations such as the ability to trade with NGX for a variety of reasons, including credit restrictions or electronic failure. [ex.  We have contracts to buy and sell Coke, somebody bought the formula for Coke, changed it to Sprite, put the Sprite in the Coke can, such that we are now forced to buy and sell Sprite under the auspices of contracts to buy and sell Coke.]In any event, no commercial alternative was viable, and we decided to commence a law suit based upon interference with economic relations, interference with contractual relations, breach of obligations of good faith, civil conspiracy and passing off.  All are viable claims but difficult to prove.  We have to get past simply being outsmarted.  We have also decided not to involve regulators or antitrust enforcement.  The discovery process will be key, and we hope to influence a commercial result that includes all electronic trading systems, including Enron Online, into the indices. The lawsuit is for injunctive relief (which will be particularly difficult) and damages of C$100MM.  We hope to garner industry support, but to date and as usual, many parties agree with our position but are not willing to get involved.  Some competitors are also happy to segregate Enron Online from the rest of the market.In terms of counsel, we initially were going to use Robert Anderson of Blake Cassels & Graydon, who we have used on many matters, but Blakes was conflicted after the injunction papers were served.  We had to find replacement counsel on short notice and, with the recommendation of Blakes but based primarily on my prior experiences, retained Clarke Hunter of Macleod Dixon.My apologies for not letting you know sooner.  I had discussed the matter with Mark before commencing the suit, and Mark asked me to drop you and Richard a line, but I simply forgot.  If you have any questions or concerns, please call at 403.974.6923.  If I don t hear from you, all the best for the holidays.Peter."

Presumably to coerce business onto the NGX system, and with two days  notice, NGX purchased the right to calculate the indices (as opposed to Enerdata itself or the publication itself) and changed the methodology for the indices to include only trades completed on NGX s system.  The result is the indices are, for contractual purposes, quite cleverly unchanged and therefore still as described in hundreds of our trading contracts and thousands of transactions, but in substance have been changed to represent only NGX s segment of the market, which introduces unmanageable volatility and unreliability, and is affected by other limitations such as the ability to trade with NGX for a variety of reasons, including credit restrictions or electronic failure. [ex.  We have contracts to buy and sell Coke, somebody bought the formula for Coke, changed it to Sprite, put the Sprite in the Coke can, such that we are now forced to buy and sell Sprite under the auspices of contracts to buy and sell Coke.]In any event, no commercial alternative was viable, and we decided to commence a law suit based upon interference with economic relations, interference with contractual relations, breach of obligations of good faith, civil conspiracy and passing off.  All are viable claims but difficult to prove.  We have to get past simply being outsmarted.  We have also decided not to involve regulators or antitrust enforcement.  The discovery process will be key, and we hope to influence a commercial result that includes all electronic trading systems, including Enron Online, into the indices. The lawsuit is for injunctive relief (which will be particularly difficult) and damages of C$100MM.  We hope to garner industry support, but to date and as usual, many parties agree with our position but are not willing to get involved.  Some competitors are also happy to segregate Enron Online from the rest of the market.In terms of counsel, we initially were going to use Robert Anderson of Blake Cassels & Graydon, who we have used on many matters, but Blakes was conflicted after the injunction papers were served.  We had to find replacement counsel on short notice and, with the recommendation of Blakes but based primarily on my prior experiences, retained Clarke Hunter of Macleod Dixon.My apologies for not letting you know sooner.  I had discussed the matter with Mark before commencing the suit, and Mark asked me to drop you and Richard a line, but I simply forgot.  If you have any questions or concerns, please call at 403.974.6923.  If I don t hear from you, all the best for the holidays.Peter."

This Program is one of his most successful and important contributions to Enron, and will continue as a cornerstone of the Company.  It remains our single most important source of new talent.The purpose of this memo is to reassure you that the direction, philosophy, and importance of the Program remains unchanged.  As we have said many times, most of our new businesses were created by graduates and members of the Program.  Many of the current leaders of our company are also graduates of the Program.Three broad principles will continue to guide the direction of the Program.?	We will have only one Associate/Analyst Program at Enron, and it is a Company asset.?	We will have a ""One Enron"" presence on campus to provide clarity of message and purpose.?	The Program is rotational in nature, and will prepare our future leaders for success by providing exposure to Enron s network of people and systems.The business prospects for Enron, and the opportunities for personal growth and development have never been better.  We also enjoy the deepest and broadest talent pool we have ever had.  Each and every one of you can be a key contributor to making Enron the World s Leading Company.cc:Billy Lemmons - Associate/Analyst ProgramJohn Sherriff - Associate/Analyst Committee ChairManagement CommitteeAssociate/Analyst CommitteeAssociate/Analyst DepartmentHuman Resources LeadsProgram PRC RepsProgram Supervisors<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>"

We are currently evaluating taking another cape on short period or fixing a COA with a distressed owner for our Q2 cargoes out of RBCT or Colombia or both.  The average earnings for a cape has fallen from a high of $25,000 in November to $18,500 today.

Paper rates have remained stagnant again lacking real physical input, nearbys marginally easier forwards flat neglected. Strategy will either be to bear spread where nearby premiums are good or bide our time and buy Q2 dips or calls.The story out of Bocimar this week is that they view this year as being definitely weaker than last year and that they feel it should average around $15,000 to $17,000 for the year ( which is still a good market for shipping ) and at those levels, they are happy to sit back and watch.   Furthermore, last week CMB ( parent company of Bocimar ) released their earnings for cal 00.  Their Dry bulk division made 60 million Euro and their tanker division made 60 million as well.  These are very good numbers for their dry bulk division taking into account the incredible rise in bunkers last year ( cost of fuelling the ships ) and the fact that their ships were often at anchor and not generating revenues.On the funny side of things, Coeclerici is having their yearly audit by Arthur Anderson and AA has discovered that although Coeclerici makes money trading FFA s, they lack proper daily position reports and models to value options.  As a result, I got a call from Koert ( head shipping at Coaclerici ) asking for our assistance as AA had mentioned to them that they should talk to us about our systems and procedures.  Being that Coeclerici is our biggest counterpart, we jumped on the opportunity to assist and Andy James is being sent to genoa Tuesday for a one day tutorial about risk controls and procedures while trying at the same time to better understand how Coeclerici values deals, which needless to say should help us in the future when negotiating with them.

(This article was originally published Monday) NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- New England consumer advocates Monday said federal energy regulators overstepped their jurisdiction in ordering the consolidation of the wholesale electricity markets and transmission systems in the northeast U.S. The Federal Energy Commission in mid-July directed operators of the power grids in New York, New England and the Mid-Atlantic to merge, as part of a sweeping series of orders designed to put control of the country s transmission system in independent hands. Federal law allows the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to require transmission systems to connect, but only at the request of a state regulators, according to a filing made by Maine law firm on behalf of consumer groups, nonprofit energy groups and the attorney general of Massachusetts. ""The Commission makes no claim in the New England Order that it is acting at the behest of a state commission or public utility, and is, therefore, without authority to mandate the involuntary combination of the Northeastern RTOs,"" the groups said in their filing, which asked FERC to reconsider its consolidation decision. FERC should give the three Northeast grid operators a transition period to evolve into three regional transmission organization, or RTOs, with similar market designs, transmission tariffs and governance structures before requiring them to merge, the filing said. The commission directed the operators of the wholesale power grid in New England, New York and the Mid-Atlantic to meet with utilities, generators, trade groups, state regulators and a FERC judge in Washington for 45 days beginning July 19 to outline plans for creating one transmission organization from Washington, D.C., to Maine. The regulators also directed Judge Peter Young to submit recommendation to them 10 days after the conclusion of the talks. The commission ordered the consolidation of the Northeast power grid ""at breakneck speed"" without studying the technical feasibility of creating one RTO and without analyzing the costs and benefits of merging, the consumer groups said in their filing. Young has directed meeting participants not to discuss the substance of the negotiations, but sources familiar with the talks said the group is outlining a business model describing how to structure a Northeast RTO without filling in the details. Participants have said, for example, that this regional market should have one transmission tariff and one interconnection standard, but haven t defined what that tariff and standard should be. ""Many people are very discouraged by the ongoing talks,"" said Anthony Buxton, an attorney with the Maine law firm that submitted Monday s filing. All 300 meeting participants have been gathering in Washington twice a week and have been working on the issues every day outside of those meetings, Young said. Next week, they will break off into smaller groups and begin meeting every day, according to Young and market participants. The commission was in turmoil when it issued its RTO decision, as evidenced by Chairman Curt Hebert s resignation last week, and should therefore reconsider its order, Buxton said. The consumer groups also asked the commission to allow residential electricity users to have a say in how the unified electricity market in the northeast U.S. will run. Market participants, including consumers, will have an advisory capacity only in this new market and won t be allowed to vote on the rules that govern the market, as they do now, Buxton said. This decision contradicted another one FERC issued in 1996 requiring utilities to open their transmission lines to competitors. In that order, the commission encouraged New England to create an independent system operator to oversee the power grid and to give market participants equal say in determining how this regional transmission system and electricity market would operate The consumer groups that filed Monday are working to galvanize other organizations representing residential customers in New England, Buxton said. ""Consumers are going to be at the forefront of a massive attack on FERC for what it s done,"" Buxton said. -By Kristen McNamara, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2061; kristen.mcna <mailto:kristen.mcnamara@dowjones.com>713-853-9287 888-703-0309"

greet,"Greetings from the land of watery-eyed, flat-assed office workers! How goes the burly mountain man thing? I ve been hearing second hand from Elliot that you re faring extremely well mentally despite some poorly crafted sleeping bags and a bad case of frostbite on your toes. (That second part I made up, but it sounded appropriate given the sleeping bag situation.) All s well here. As you could imagine, and probably often do, the sweeping expanse of people staring at computers that is Enron has changed not at all since you left. There are still many computers, many of them have changed positions, some have gone away, most we are not sad to see go. That s just the nature of this cutthroat business. Also on the stagnantly invariable list is the status of my life in relation to Enron. I am still here. I still stare at the computer. Every once in awhile I meander over to the dark window-less corner that enshrouds the IT wizards and ask them silly questions like, ""What does it mean when I hit this button and my screen starts flashing at me like a disco ball, then makes this awkward shrieking noise and finally goes black?"" They are incredibly helpful. I am still pretty much clueless about most things, although I ve learned to talk about them with a semblance of authority, as in, ""No, you twit, the 25 megawatt off peak deal should clearly be flowing across SP-15 to NP-15 because of the illiquidity of SP s market right now. What kind of idiot wouldn t hedge their position in California at a time like this?"" It all sounds very exotic and important to me, which is why I m still here. But I m infinitely jealous of your wild exploits in the great American outdoors. I suspect my forbearance for sitting in an office will run out right around the middle of the summer, so I m planning a trip to coincide with that meltdown. I haven t decided between a road trip through the western United States or just a direct flight to Paris. Both sound good, and way beyond my budget, therefore equally attractive. Well, I ve managed to say practically nothing for long enough now. I do hope you re having an amazing time, rambling on toward the next crazy adventure on the horizon as I believe Jack Kerouac once wrote. We re all very proud of you here and constantly refer to you as ""my good friend Winston who s skiing across the state of Wyoming, which was my idea."" I d love to hear about your trip direct from the source, although I know you re extremely busy out there, skiing and killing wild animals for sustenance and whatnot. But please do write back....if you can still move your fingers.Sincerely,Kate(the slightly ditsy one who sits in the middle of the room and tries to look constantly busy)"

The Packet activity can be combined and reported as one number.

deliver,"Good Morning! Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month. For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston s low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow. So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation s gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter.

deliver,"Energy Firms  Mixed Message Is Focus of Inquiry Deregulation: Senate panel will investigate whether suppliers were being misleading when they promised lower rates for consumers while they were also predicting bigger profits for investors. By ROBERT J. LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers In the summer of 1999, a top official with a major player in California s power market testified during a congressional committee hearing in support of speeding up deregulation. Unleashing market forces, said the Dynegy Inc. executive, would ensure ""maximum customer savings"" and ""low-cost power."" That same month, the Houston-based firm made a far different pitch to Wall Street: Deregulation and major swings in electricity prices would boost revenue and stock value. ""We know how to take advantage of volatility spikes across the gas and power market,"" Chief Executive Officer Charles Watson declared in a publication targeting large investors. ""The energy marketplace,"" he predicted, ""will simply get more volatile."" Dynegy was not alone, a review of federal filings, company documents and public records shows. In the years since California s pioneering deregulation plan was approved, other major out-of-state energy suppliers were sending similar, seemingly contradictory signals to the public and stock buyers.Now, those divergent messages--electricity prices will fall but corporate revenue and profits will climb--will be a key focus of a special state Senate committee charged with investigating the alleged manipulation in the power market.""How you can tell your investors you re about to make a whole ton of money in the very short term, and tell the consumers of California you re about to get lower rates?"" said Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), a former consumer attorney who is heading the legislative probe. Investigations by the state attorney general and federal regulators are continuing, but remain largely secret.The Senate panel could offer the most open and wide-ranging examination yet of alleged misconduct among power sellers. The bipartisan panel expects to begin requesting documents from power producers as early as today and begin hearings in a few weeks. Committee members stress that they are hoping the power companies will cooperate but are ready to issue subpoenas if necessary.Suppliers Deny Misleading PublicThe legislative probe comes as many state officials are moving aggressively to expose alleged market manipulation and overcharges totaling billions of dollars by the power suppliers.""Somewhere along the line, there may be a skunk in the woodpile. And if there is, we need to find out about it,"" said K. Maurice Johannessen (R-Redding), the committee s ranking Republican.Another panel member, Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), noted that all companies try to maximize profits. ""But [we want] to understand how the market was manipulated and how sellers took advantage of the market.""The power traders strongly deny acting improperly or sending misleading signals to the public.""Hogwash,"" said Tom Williams, spokesman for North Carolina-based Duke Energy. Spokesmen for Dynegy said there was nothing inconsistent in the statements of their executives.The companies maintain that California s problems stem from soaring electricity demand, lagging power plant construction and a faulty deregulation plan adopted by the Legislature in 1996. ""You have a flawed structure there,"" said Dynegy spokesman John Sousa.Sousa and executives of other power suppliers say their comments to the general public and to Wall Street are not contradictory because unfettered competition--not the California model--would have created opportunities to both make money and cut rates.Still, regulators, lawmakers and ratepayer groups note that only half the promises made by the power dealers have been realized so far--their earnings and stock prices have risen at record rates as electricity prices have soared.""The big lie was, while they were telling ratepayers to  Trust us, we re going to lower your rates,  they were planning the entire time to raise the rates,"" said San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre, a former federal prosecutor who specialized in fraud cases. Aguirre is representing state ratepayers in a class-action lawsuit against the power companies.Just last month, California s independent grid operator reported that many power sellers ""used well-planned strategies to ensure maximum possible prices."" Potential overcharges could total nearly $6.3 billion. The Senate panel wants to track information that Dynegy and other generators were providing to the investment community in the 1990s as a possible way of determining whether they entered the California market with plans to run up electricity costs. Among many other things, the committee plans to seek internal projections of how the firms expected wholesale prices and profits to rise under deregulation. Members also want to know how the suppliers expected to recoup billions in outlays for California power plants being unloaded by regulated utilities. Some of the purchases were far above book value, stunning analysts.""What did they know that the rest of us didn t at the time they were purchasing those generations facilities?"" asked Dunn. ""They knew something.""One thing the power wholesalers say they did know was that tight power supplies in California would probably boost prices, at least for a time.""They were going anywhere where they thought energy [use] would spike upward,"" recalled market analyst Joan Goodman, who was familiar with company pitches. ""California was one of those places because it didn t have sufficient [power] plants.""Duke Energy projected that prices would rise after 2000, although the company says it did not foresee the huge increases that occurred, according to spokesman Williams.However, when the company sealed one of the first packages of power plant purchases in the state in 1997, Chief Executive Officer Richard Priory said in a press release it would ""deliver greater value"" to California customers.The publicity spin was similar when Edison s sprawling beachfront power plant in El Segundo changed hands the following year. ""Consumers in California will begin to benefit from more competitively priced electricity and more vibrant economy,"" announced Craig Mataczynski, vice president of Minneapolis-based NRG Corp., a partner in the purchase with Dynegy.Big Growth Was PredictedUtilities reaping profits from plant sales also trumpeted the consumer windfall theme. Electricity rates would drop 20% by 2001, Pacific Gas & Electric s top executive, Robert Glynn, said in early 1998. ""There is no product bought on a daily basis that has such a predictable downward price trajectory into the future.""But to its Wall Street audience, the power suppliers emphasized climbing revenues.Atlanta-based Southern Co., now Mirant, told investors in 1999 that its plan to buy plants and market power had brought the company to the ""doorstep of significant growth opportunities.""""We believe our strategies will result in the best shareholder return available,"" Bill Dahlberg, then-chief executive officer, said shortly after buying three California plants.Mirant spokeswoman Jamie Stephenson said assurances given the public and assumptions directed to Wall Street were ""just a different way of delivering the same message."" The firm was saying it would be ""reliable to shareholders and reliable to consumers.""Now, with rolling blackouts and record electricity bill increases, federal and state authorities are alleging that large energy suppliers played the power market too hard.Last month, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said it found evidence of $124 million in ""unjust and unreasonable"" charges during the severest periods of electricity shortage. The commission, often criticized for being too lenient on private power companies, ordered the firms to refund the money or further justify the charges.Some firms are contesting the findings, saying the prices they charged were justified. Investigators and regulators have faced a vexing challenge trying to unravel the complex financial workings of the large power traders. The companies closely guard information, and some recently refused to comply with subpoenas from the state Public Utilities Commission, which is also probing the power market.Whether the Senate investigating committee will have the resources and tenacity to get much further remains to be seen. But Democrats and Republicans alike insist they are serious about untangling how the power market went haywire.""I haven t seen that much smoke where there hasn t been a fire,"" Dunn said.

deliver,"	Ranelle, John and Michelle,  thought I would send this statement to you and see if this	helps simplify our answer to your question.  	The question is:  How is MDQ used in the nomination system to ensure we do not	double up on MDQ volumes when we have split paths (i.e. nom on same contract	from (1) Mid 15 to Bushton Inlet and from (2) Bushton Outlet to Demac)	For Nominating purposes:	MDQ of contract = Primary Firm + Alternate Firm up to the MDQ. 	Anything over the MDQ will be Overrun and charged at the IT rate.	Point MDQ needs to be considered when allocating a receipt point.	EXAMPLE:	If the Field MDQ is 10,000, then we will  (1) total the reciepts nominated on the	contract; (2) compare the total nominated to the Contract MDQ.  Then the shipper	will get firm (primary and alternate) up to their contract MDQ.  Anything over will be 	overrun at IT rate.	If anyone has any other questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn"

The partnership may be called ""Panda Gila River L.P.""Here are some of the details as we know them:	All building/ air permits received, construction has commenced	Financing closed 6/04/01 (oversubscribed by 56%)	$2.2 bn loan ($1.7bn 5 yr. bullet loan and $500mm equity bridge)	Financing led by Citibank and Societe Generale	50% of power output sold under long term contracts, 50% on spot marketWhat we want to know is:	How did the banks get comfortable on the financing if only 25% of the gas pipeline transport capacity is under contract? (And right now there is only one pipeline capable of serving the plant s needs)How did the banks get comfortable with only 50% of the power output sold under long term contracts?What happens after the bullet loan comes due-- are the operators taking interest rate risk and hoping to refinance at a lower rate in year 5?Any information you can provide on the above would be very helpful.

propose,"A few thoughts before the NG meeting --1.	Maybe we should (as a team) call Transelect (Paul Buckman) before our NG meeting.  You may remember that Transelect sent an initial letter into Skilling to try and solicit our support for stopping the NG application to be managing member of the ARTO.  I think that it would be good to call Buckman and ask if he has a better idea than NG.  We are right now stuck between two very bad answers - let AEP and FE construct a managing member or have NG.  Maybe Transelect has a better solution.2.	Chief Issues with NG --a.	are they ""really"" independent?  having a short position in NY and owning generation in NE effectively makes NG into a ""market participant"" - I think that Enron should make as a hold firm position that to operate an RTO there can be no agreement with anything less than almost perfect independence.b.	who do they feel the customer is?  maybe we want to get Paul Dawson s take on their business model from the UK.  it is critical that the new RTO operators across the country view traders/marketers and generators as their key customers.  what form of regulation for cost recovery of their operating expenses do they want - pass thru, PBR, etc.? c.	who writes the tariff?  I would make a strong argument that the problem with most of the RTO work to date has been that FERC has allowed the current incumbents to first write a bad tariff and then assign the provision of service under that tariff to someone who has very little (if any) control over future changes.  the RTO operator must be free to make changes to the tariff with only two constraints - (1) must not restrict the ability to pay facility revenue reqts and (2) must not damage the assets.  d.	do they intend to build/own transmission and how does this impact the energy markets?  will their planning and construction processes impact any long term positions that EPMI may take in the energy market.  how do they manage to allow other merchant transmission into the business?e.	how do they intend to provide balancing energy?  the flip side of our fight on congestion management involves the pricing of energy imbalances.  what is NG intending to do on this issue?  does NG believe that multiple control areas makes sense for a single RTO?  does NG support unbalanced/uncovered schedules day-ahead?  Also, just to let people know, Kerry Stroup will also be working on the Midwest RTO efforts going forward.  Please keep him included on the e-mails.Jim -----Original Message-----From: 	Allegretti, Daniel  Sent:	Thursday, August 09, 2001 12:30 PMTo:	Steffes, James D.; Shapiro, Richard; Roan, MichaelSubject:	Meeting with N.

(Tampa Electric) have formed a partnership to build, own, and operate a 2300 Mw gas-fired electric generation plant located in Maricopa County, Arizona, southwest of Phoenix.  The partnership may be called ""Panda Gila River L.P.""Here are some of the details as we know them:	All building/ air permits received, construction has commenced	Financing closed 6/04/01 (oversubscribed by 56%)	$2.2 bn loan ($1.7bn 5 yr. bullet loan and $500mm equity bridge)	Financing led by Citibank and Societe Generale	50% of power output sold under long term contracts, 50% on spot marketWhat we want to know is:	How did the banks get comfortable on the financing if only 25% of the gas pipeline transport capacity is under contract? (And right now there is only one pipeline capable of serving the plant s needs)How did the banks get comfortable with only 50% of the power output sold under long term contracts?What happens after the bullet loan comes due-- are the operators taking interest rate risk and hoping to refinance at a lower rate in year 5?Any information you can provide on the above would be very helpful.  We are scheduled to meet with Panda in Dallas on Tuesday 11/6.thanks for the help.Kevin Hyatt713-853-5559"

National Fuel transferred 1,000,000 dth from our parking contract to our brand new firm storage contract.  We are now long FSS and short PALS. FSS We have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 33,333 dth per day.  However, we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 33,333 dth on any given day.  Also, the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect, like Trco-Leidy.  We do not have to ship the gas on Nat Fuel.  IASWe give Nat Fuel the gas back on an IT basis via our IAS agreement (Nat Fuel is still setting up the contracts).  We can give Nat Fuel the gas back at any point we wish.  We do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we withdraw on the FSS.  And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it.COSTWhat we will probably do most of the time is take the FSS into Trco at Leidy and payback the IAS agreement at Niagara and Leidy.  ENA will pay Nat Fuel 1,000,000 dth x ($.125 / 3 months) or $41,666.67 per month for June, July, and August.  This deal is over on Aug 31st.  I just entered the demand charge on my Market East demand charge sheet.  I do not have any deals set up in Sitara.  I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first.  I will keep track of the balances on an Excel worksheet.  All commodity cost and fuel is capured in the $.125 demand charge.  Beavy and I will make sure the payback and withdrawal tickets are balanced in Sitara once we start flowing gas on this deal.  If we payback 60,000 dth next week and we do not have any withdrawals, then I will show a 60,000 dth withdrawal on 8/31/2000 just to keep the tickets balanced.Payback TechniquesUnder the expert eye of the wonderfull, superfantastic, all-around great guy, Dick Jenkins, I ve come up with some options on paying back the gas.Niagara - only works when Niagara is open.  Nat Fuel has been very close to capacity this week.  However, we should always see what Martin can do with the gas if it gets backed up into TCPL.  OR if Niagara is constrained, we can ship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel, at today s prices that cost about $.105Wadd - take our Tenn Z6 length into CNG via Iroq, ship it to Trco- Leidy, and payback the gas at Leidy.  At today s prices, that cost about  $.055, assuming we get to roll over all of our CNG fuel waivers.Tenn -   we just need to see what type of IT rate Dan can get to ship the Gulf to Tenn Z4 (Ellisburgh).  We can also move the Dracutt to Nat Fuel on segmented capacity for $.145 or  move Wright to Nat Fuel for $.11.  We cannot use the Net 284 contract on any of the Tenn / Nat Fuel interconnects.Let me know if you have any questons."

Media General wants the cross-default to be reciprocal at $100 millionfor both Media General and Enron.2.   Further, Media General thinks that this should be a cross-acceleration,not a cross-default.3.   Page 3 of Schedule.  The ""date by which to be delivered"" for Party Bshould track the same with Party A: i.e., if financials are available onEDGAR then they would not be automatically provided by MG on a quarterlybasis.4.  Page 4 of Schedule.  Under (a), add ""Attn.: Chief Financial Officer"".We will send Marshall Morton s fax and telephone numbers.5.  We will let you know who will serve as process agent.  We would like totalk about governing law in Texas and the site of arbitration in Houston.6.  Page 6 of Schedule.  In clause(b)(g), please note that MG intends toassign this agreement and we want to make sure that does not affect thisrepresentation.7.Page 8 of Schedule.  MG wants the right to assign this agreement to aparty with a credit agreement equivalent to a certain level.  We can discusswhat that level should be.  We should discuss what Enron s credit rating isin this connection.Transaction Confirmation Document.1. MG does not think this transaction should be characterized as a""swaption"".  This was to be a deal for the purchase of newsprint at a fixedprice, not at Enron s option.2. We want todiscuss the expiration date. We should also discuss the otherdates and terms which are blank.  On page 2, under ""Additional Provisions"",the date for satisfying conditions is clearly wrong since it refers to July5.  Once again, all of this ties in with not being an option, but a fixedagreement.3. We would like to have Enron render a monthly settlement statement with anet amount being paidto/receivable from MG.  No netting is presentlyprovided for in the agreement.ISDA Credit Support AnnexMG  would like to delete this entirely and would propose that Enron wouldrely on the general cross-acceleration provisions.  Media General nevercontemplated credit provisions more onerous than its credit agreements.          I will have the Media General business people follow up with thepeople at Enron, but could you please have some one get in touch with me onthis.Thanks,John"

remind,"Good Afternoon Sara,I just wanted to follow up on the status of the documentation for this deal structure.Please advise.Regards,Jorge -----Original Message-----From: 	Garcia, Jorge A.   Sent:	Thursday, September 06, 2001 12:18 PMTo:	Shackleton, SaraCc:	Heard, Marie; Vitrella, David J.; Adams, LaurelSubject:	CSFB 2001 Equity Swap Basket DocumentationGood Morning Sara,I wanted to touch base with you regarding the CSFB 2001 Equity Swap Basket documentation. Since the last time we spoke here are some of the issues discussed along with some additional recommendations.1) Finalizing the Master ISDA Agreement with Credit Suisse First Boston (Europe) Limited. I see that the status is under Credit Review.2) Definitions:	a) Interest Payment Date- should state ""3 business days after the Valuation Date""	b) Reference Price- amend the phrase ""..last regular way trade..."" to state ""...Official Closing Price..."" in (i) and (ii)(b)(iii).	c) Securities- Omit the reference to ""Bonds"". The definition should only read: ""are the securities specified as such in the Confirmation"".	d) Valuation Date (s)- October 15, 2001, November 15, 2001, ... October 15, 2002	3) Section 5.1 (i)- Omit the reference to Bonds. This section (i) should read: ""If a Security pays a dividend or makes another distribution, the payment to be made by the Seller shall be equal to the gross amount of the cash dividend or distribution per share (excluding for the avoidance of doubt any tax credits), as the case may be, multiplied by the Dividend Percentage, multiplied by the Contract Quantity"".We should include a definition for ""Dividend Payment Date"" to read, ""The Equity Payment Date relating to the Valuation Date (s) on which the relevant Dividend Period ends"". We should also include a definition for ""Dividend Amount"". The ""Dividend Amount"" definition should read, ""100% of all ordinary cash dividends where; (i) the ex-dividend date occurs during the period from the day following the Trade Date to and including the final Valuation Date and (ii) the date on which the related ordinary cash dividend would have been received by persons who held the Shares comprising the Basket during such period is during the relevent Dividend Period"".I believe we should address Section 5.2 ""Potential Adjustment Event"". We should recommend replacing the language similar to the Intra-Period Adjustment language we utilitized in the Enron Credit Confirmation. Their section allows CSFB to ""determine"" the provisions of the Intra-Period Adjustments. CSFB should not have control over determining any additonal payment or adjustment of the Opening Price or Contract Quantity. The Intra-Period adjustment language is comprehensive in covering all provisions therein.4) Schedule to Basket Swaps:	a) Applicable Interest Rate Cycle: should read ""1 month""	b) Termination Date: should read ""1 year""	c) Business Day Convention: should be the standard ISDA ""Modified Following Business Day Convention"" language.5) We should also include the Annex structure to be able to monitor the positions held, along with any subsequent adjustments, in the Equity Swap Basket at any time throughout the deal.Please advise if you like to meet to discuss the documentation in further detail.Regards,Jorge A.

(""EPMI""), Enron Energy Services Inc. (""EES""), Enron EnergyMarketing Corporation (""EEMC""), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. (EESO)and Portland General Electric Corporation (""Portland General"")(collectivelysometimes referred to as the ""Enron Entities"")Harvey, Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued bythe California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter ""the Commission"").The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking itsinvestigation into the problems in the California electric markets byproducing a limited quantity of specified information on a timely basis.  Webelieve that the limited production we propose will enable the Commission tocommence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced tolitigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production,which are, by any standard, extremely broad and could involve millions ofpages of documents.  We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchangeof October 3, 2000 with the understanding that the Commission agrees that bycooperating, offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entitieshave not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoeverand that any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise orother responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in thefuture, if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documentsthat are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney workproduct privileges. [SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION:  Generally speaking, the documents andinformation that the Commission seeks can be found, if they exist, withinEPMI, EES and Portland General.  To the extent that EEMC or EESO arerelevant to the Commission s investigation, any documents would be locatedwithin EES.  Thus, we do not anticipate specific document productions fromeither EEMC or EESO.]GENERAL DOCUMENTSRequests 1 through 4 The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations havingacquired, sold, divested, joint ventured, spun off and otherwise reorganizedthemselves extensively during the past two years.  The burden and expense onEnron to locate, and produce every corporate organizational chart anywherein its organization since April 1, 1998 is significant.   The Enron entitieswill provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizationalcharts, telephone directories and so called ""family trees"" to show itscurrent organization.  To the extent that Enron can readily identify andlocate exemplars of significant organizational charts, telephone directoriesor so called ""family trees"" for earlier periods it will also make thoseavailable.  One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on itscorporate history.  If a list of those books would be helpful, we canprovide it.  With respect to the other entities, to the extent thatcorporate histories can be found, they will be produced.  We anticipateproducing these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000.Requests 5 and 6 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 willidentify their relationship to affiliated companies and the TransactionDocuments will identify its customers and suppliers.FINANCIAL DOCUMENTSRequests 7 through 11 The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the periodrequested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, EES, and Portland Generalwill provide to the Commission electronic Transaction Documents for thepurchase and sale of energy delivered which includes economic data.   It isintended that this economic data will provide the Commission with financialinformation regarding the Enron Entities which will be useful to itsinvestigation.   We anticipate producing public filings regarding financialdata on October 13, 2000 and the electronic Transaction Documents in thesecond wave of document productions.GENERATING DOCUMENTSRequests 12, 14 and 18 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generationfacilities are limited in number and there will probably be limiteddocuments available.  The Enron Entities to the extent they act as ascheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generationoutput, do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generationunit requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General, do havedocuments and information for Enron Wind, Saguaro and Las VegasCogeneration.  We propose to produce these documents in the second wave ofdocument productions.  For Portland General, the production of the requested documentswould involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General ownedtwenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about onehalf of its total energy demand.  As a result, we question whether theeffort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on theCalifornia wholesale market is necessarily limited.  In addition, thosetransactions which do involve Portland General sales into California arelimited to sales to the ISO and PX, and long term contracts with two smallCalifornia municipal utilities.  Thus, the Commission will receive theessential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO andPX.  Nevertheless, Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data beingprovided by other Enron Entities, to the extent relevant.  [We propose thatthe Commission defer requesting production of other information until it hasreviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion oftheir energy into the California market.  At that time a more accurateassessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuablegiven the limited impact of Portland General generation on the Californiawholesale market.][Alternate ending to paragraph:   We propose for the voluminous PortlandGeneral generating cost and maintenance data, that these documents be madeavailable in Portland for inspection from a representative sampling offacilities.  If there are specific documents that the Commission would likecopied from that production, we can discuss the arrangements for producingthese documents.  We propose to make these documents available in Portlandin a third wave of document productions]TRANSACTION DOCUMENTSRequests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19 We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data forthe purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of transaction datafor year 2000 (in California and outside of California and Real Time) forthe purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date, counterparty,quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is a purchase or asale.   Because of the speed with which you want this information, it ispossible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate.  For thosetransactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, weunderstand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there willnot be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI scustomer on an accounting system rather than as part of the tradingbusiness.  EES is a retail provider of electricity, and plays a far morelimited role in the wholesale markets which are the subject of theCommission investigation.  However, EES can also provide similar electronicTransaction Data with the proviso that it will not include the specificnames of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customernumber.  This additional restriction is important to EES because many ofEES s customers have agreements whereby they must be notified of anysubpoena and provided an opportunity to object.  EES cannot meet your timeframe to release information and give its customers the notice they require.Given that EES was a retail provider and the fact that the identity ofretail customers is of little or no relevance to the functioning of thewholesale market, we do not believe protecting the identity of retailcustomers is an unreasonable limitation or narrowing of the request.  Weanticipate producing the transaction data in the second wave of documentproductions.FERC DOCUMENTSRequest 20 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they receivedfrom FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies ofthose responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,2000. Based upon discussions that we have had with the various EnronEntities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions onFriday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities couldmake that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available forproduction by then. We propose to make these productions with the understanding that ifany entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currentlyin place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will beprotected by the most stringent protective order.  In addition, if, at therequest of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or acourt of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production belimited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right tolimit the production of documents in conformance with such order. We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us knowif they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions orcomments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Dayor myself.Brobeck Phleger & Harrison LLPGary Fergus=======================================================This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

However the fact remains that fundamentals have changed little in the past month with the same supply issues which served to tighten this mkt over the last eight weeks continuing to keep a firm hold on the market throughout Q4 and Q1 2001. Indeed with the ocean frt market still steeply inverted for the winter versusthe rest of the year ( $11 versus $9.50 RBCT/ARA) and with the U.S mkt experiencing a massive squeeze front end (east coasttrading $35 fob barge) there is little sign of relief in the short term - Q1 2001 Fob ARA is now trading close to $44 with Jan/Dec2001 around $43.25. Producers will of course lead us to believe that the origin markets are structured in a steep contango forthe remainder of the year, however leaving the issue of mkt consolidation aside there is little in the mkt to justify this - if anythingdemand in the Far East looks a little shakier with steel orders slowing down and the financial markets under pressure and forecastsfor European demand estimate unchanged demand year on year. While a marked sell off for second half of the year is unlikely wesee the forward curve on the fob origin side flat going forward rather than contango. This said we cannot preclude a shift higherof absolute prices for the whole curve from where we are today at around $33 Fob South Africa equivalent to $35 - there is stillplenty of business to be done for 2001 and my feeling is that consumers will end up buying into it rather than risk the wait andsee game - we cannot underestimate the influence on international prices that the cartel hold and even if this is exaggeratedit s implication is enuff to create a bullish psychology.SPOT TRADES 150,000mt of Pinang quality from KPC for Dec shipment at $27.60 Fob Indo basis 6000 kcal/kg160,000mt of Prima  quality from KPC for Nov shipment at $30.15 Fob Indo basis 6400 kcal/kg150,000mt option of Prima quality from KPC - to be shipped latest end June at $30.65 Fob Indo basis 6400 kcal/kg.2 x 150,000mt Put Options from TXU for April/Sep and Oct/Mar 02 respectively.

Premium - $0.50 cents.SELLING SIDEBritish Energy - pitching a 1,3 and 5 year deal to them as an extension to current contract we have with them which runs outend March.Scotts Power - looking to turn present Feb cape commitment from CIF to  FOR deal and sell incremental cape for March arrival.H Del C - offering them a 9 year put option basis the SECA.Endessa - we have offered them 4 plus 1 cape business  for 2001 based on $31 Fob South Africa.NCSC - looking at doing various geographical swaps and they will be utilising EOL in the next week to hedge some of their implied short position.Heidelberger - offered them a hdymax of South African material CNF Turkey for November delivery at $47.50.Bremen - shud sign within the month an eight year deal with Stadtwerke Bremen supplying them some 850,000mt of genericquality coal on an annual basis.Bewag - currently working an offer to supply 1 million mt for 2001 on delivered stockpile basisENBW/Neckarverke/Preag - offering Oz material for Nov/Dec just shy of $43 fob ARA.Braunschweig - offered them 3 x 60,000mt for Mar/Jun/Jly delivery into Nordenham at $43.75 cif. Dyckerhoff - offered 4 x 15,000mt of generic South Africa material for April/November delivery at $43.50 fob barge.BUYING SIDEDuiker - Have put various structures in front of Duiker which involves us buying a cape a quarter for 2001 - they are due to getback to us within the next few days.Drummond - offered us a 5 year deal staring in 2002 at $35 Fob Colombia - thanks!!Krutrade - working numbers to put an aggressive multi-year offer in front of Krutrade as they seem to be the movers in the Russianmkt at present - we must establish a decent source of Russian coal within our portfolio to service our Bremen and Bewag businessgoing forward.Anker - talking with them re securing south african stem out of Maputo for 2001 - they are looking at somewhere around the $27 fobMaputo level.Masefield - currently in talks with them to secure some tonnage out of Santa Marta for 2001.Coal Procurement - talking about securing a hdymax shipment per quarter out of Durban for 2001Currently working with U.S. on finalising numbers for Synfuel supplies for 2001 but currently remain $0.75 - $1.00 apart.We currently have some 50mmt of Colombian coal sitting on the ground in Amsterdan/Rotterdam to sell as fillers into backendof the year and we have the M.V. Cleopatra Dream arriving in Rotterdam on Nov 26 with 143mmt of Australian coal to sell intothe mkt.EOLMuch of the talk at Coaltrans centred around the press release from GlobalCoal of the intention of the Cartel plus Rio to launch an e-platform which will provide mkts against 3 Fob origin points and an ARA delivery point. Details of operational functionalityare scarce and increasingly it looks like this is explained by fact that they themselves do not know but general consensus reckonsit will be operational end of first quarter 01. Rather than see this as competition, if successful it could provide us with more accessto markets than we have previously had and there shud be some fun and games to be had with the various producers.  Total volumes for EOL to date are at 1,700,000mt. We have seen a lot of interest in our options which in not surprising given current mkt conditions as consumers look to hedge themselves with cheap out of the money options. As volatility increases other non-traditional coal players are also entering the mkt to utilise the opportunities which increasingly volatility presents. Next project is to get quotes in Euros andafter that we will begin to look at spark spreads via EOL.GAMEPLANWe had a major cuppla weeks on the buying side prior to Coaltrans - 75% of which is owned through optionality out of RBCT at between$30 and $31.50. Additional avenues into South Africa through Maputo and Durban now means that we have a decent portfolio of SouthAfrican material to add to our Colombian long. Overall our position is some 2.5 million mt long including the latest Indonesian purchases -our efforts now are focused on securing some of the term business which is out there at current numbers - it is difficult to call this mktin either direction with any certainty and hence we are busy covering any downside potential with a host of put options which the utilitiesare keen to mkt in this bullish enviroment. After weeks of writing that we need to add other origins to our long portfolio we look in far bettershape today with good prospects to add further flexibility in terms of diversity of origins which ultimately reduces our reliance on Drummond.While the mkt in general is still seemingly unable to grasp the true value of an option we will continue to exploit this chink by owning asmuch flexibility as possible thru physical put and call options.Best RegardsJez"

Since arbitration is the final stage in the dispute resolution process agreed by the parties and it has been agreed that there should be continuity until any dispute is finally resolved, this position should properly apply to each stage of the dispute resolution process. I suggest that since the dispute resolution procedure envisages continuity, until resolution, that Consumers should continue to invoice on the basis that they have done for the last few years. Richard, we will need your input as to whether we could argue the above with a sufficient degree of confidence to persuade a judge to make an order of specific performance as against Consumers to invoice using the basis that they have been using for the last few years, pending outcome of the dispute resolution process. Further, whether you believe that we will be entitled to seek such equitable relief. We need to take control of this process and ensure that Consumers are always playing catch-up, if we fail to do so we will be playing catch-up and will be out of pocket until the conclusion of the arbitration process. If we do not get Consumers to invoice and pay the sums we believe are due, there will be no incentive on Consumers to start the process and every opportunity for them to delay any resolution of this dispute. I have spoken with Sandy Hollingsworth who will be sending me copies of documents that Dynegy have uncovered which she believes further assist our case. Once I receive them we ought to meet to review and obtain a better understanding of the case we are able to make and the case which may be made against us. Is there any other evidence that we, or Dynegy, should be collecting at this stage, such as interviewing individuals who were involved in the negotiations/discussions with Consumers?

Even if Enron is a ""hot button""these days, we remain big fans of yours.In regard to your comments on the letter, I disagree with some of theassertions.First, I am fairly confident that no major piece of energy legislationwill be passed this year.  As you can see from the attachedcongressional update for the DE Task Force prepared by Bev Jones (formerVP for Consolidated Natural Gas), Jimmy Hayes (former Member ofCongress, and Nancy Etkin (former head of Natural Gas VehicleCoalition), there is every indication that legislation is going to getbottled up in the Senate.  I agree with the assessment.Moreover, the legislation that is being considered has almost nothing init of direct relevance to ""getting it right"" in regard to restructuring.Without pressure, I expect no federal leadership on restructuringissues.  While I do agree that commissions are usually a stallingtactic, both Ken and I are dismayed at the lack of focus, resources(i.e., DOE has devoted almost nothing of any sort to restructuring) andlack of qualified personnel directed at promoting more competition inthe energy market.  While you and I may have some idea of what isnecessary (and that is a stretch for me -- given the complexity of thechallenges), I can safely say the vast majority of folks have no ideawhat to do -- especially about the tricky jurisdictional questionsinvolved.I personally think one way to craft a ""new federalism"" on restructuringis to bribe the states into more action.  The federal government doesthis with education, housing, etc.  Why not with restructuring?  Acarrot for those states which are moving forward, linked to definitemetrics of progress and openness.I also strongly believed that state PUCS and federal agencies like FERCare being pushed to the limit about what they can accomplish givendeclining budgets and personnel.  I further think that this slows thewhole process down.  Think about it -- telephone deregulation, a growingcrisis in regard to water, record levels of mergers and acquisitions,historic changes in regard to natural gas and electric regulation -- allpiled on top of each other for these folks.Good catch on the numbering of the recommendations cited in the letter.This has been corrected.I look forward to seeing you in September at the Board meeting.JamieP.S.

While I amalways supportive of more public statements pushing competition, neitherI nor Enron can sign on to the letter.First, I am concerned that having Enron sign on will distract from yourmessages.  Enron is a ""hot button"" in DC and will change the properfocus.In addition, I would argue that the recommendation for a nationalcommission is out of place with the current timing of FERC andCongressional action -- which is imminent -- while a commission woulddelay action on the Hill and at FERC, thus supporting the forces againstcompetition.  Let s not study this too much - we know what to do.  Moveaway from the commission.Also, I m not sure how providing federal grant money only to states thatpromote competition supports our efforts.  Making GA pay for PA is adistraction from the main fights at FERC and on the Hill.Finally, I would guess that more funds to FERC and other agencies willonly be used to increase enforcement against those in the industry.While Enron wants markets that work well, the core problem is that wehaven t deregulated enough - not that markets aren t working.Also, I don t know where the recommendation numbers from the Bush/Cheneyplan came from -- I think it was an earlier document -- there are nosuch numbers in the final printed version of the report that I have.If you want to talk, please let me know.Thanks,Jim**********************************************************************This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliateand may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use ofthe intended recipient (s).

Gray Davis  (D) tentative agreement to buy Southern California Edison s (SCE) transmission assets will face tough scrutiny from suspicious lawmakers who do not believe it is in the best interest of ratepayers. State regulators are also expressing concern about the deal and consumer advocates are predicting its demise.""There are two alternatives,"" says the Bowen source. ""Lawmakers will either fashion a better deal or allow SCE to work out their problems in bankruptcy court."" Bowen is the chair of the Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee.The deal calls for SCE to sell its transmission assets to the state Department of Water Resources (DWR) for 2.3 times its book value or $2.76 billion. The agreement also calls for the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to establish a rate plan so that $3.5 billion of debt could be recovered by SCE for its power purchases before the state began buying electricity in January. ""This is the single most important cash flow provision of the memorandum of understanding,"" says a source with the state Office of Ratepayer Advocate (ORA). ""SCE will collect all of the costs they have incurred."" ORA had argued against bailing SCE out of debt saying its parent company had ample funds.In return for the premium paid in excess of the value of its transmission assets, SCE has agreed to sell the output of its generating plants at cost-based rates.""Because of the premium, cost-based rates should be lower,"" says the ORA source.""The senator is very skeptical,"" says the Bowen source. ""The deal is a great benefit for generators and utilities but little, if any, benefit for ratepayers.""The source says there is also concern with the SCE deal because it will only involve about a third of the 32,000 miles of transmission lines in the state.""If you buy a third of a bridge don t you wind up getting wet"" asks the Bowen source. Davis has expressed optimism that the state will eventually obtain all of the state s utility transmission lines. Pacific Gas & Electric s (PG&E) bankruptcy filing has complicated the governor s plan, but Davis says the state can now obtain the assets through the courts. However, the state must now compete with private companies intent on the same thing. Negotiations between the state and San Diego Gas & Electric are continuing.The Bowen source says provisions in the deal which fashion a way for generators to collect all they are owed by SCE is also of concern to lawmakers.""The state s position was that the rates charged by generators were unjust and unreasonable,"" says the source. ""If you now pay the generators you have, at the very least, a public relations problem.""The source says there may also be a court fight over the issue.""The creditors dealing with PG&E in bankruptcy court would probably want the same treatment,"" says the source. ""This creates an intriguing whipsaw effect.""A bill outlining the terms of the agreement between the state must be introduced before official consideration begins in the legislature. A source with UCAN says a bill based on the present agreement will never be passed.""If it survives, it will be modified,"" says the source.

If it is, then whatobligation does NCNG have with respect to the construction of a deliverypoint.  I haven t reviewed the annexation statutes yet, but based on myinitial reading of the Service Area Territory Agreement between Rocky Mountand NCNG, once annexed the site would come within Rocky Mount s purview toserve, and, although a ""mutually agreeable"" delivery point would have to benegotiated, NCNG would at least have to negotiate that in good faith.The January 13, 1992 Service Area Territory Agreement gives Rocky Mount theright to distribute natural gas within the city s incorporated limits aswell as a specified area outside the incorporated limits.   The contractgoes on to provide that should any part of that perimeter be annexed intothe city, ""the respective rights of the parties as to service in any suchportion shall be determined by applicable case law and the General Statutesof North Carolina. . .""  The contract further provides that absent an orderof the NCUC to the contrary, NCNG agrees that Rocky Mount has the right toserve all end users within the ""aforementioned"" area--presumably referringto the annexed area, although the agreement is not a model of clarity.So, at least based on this language, Rocky Mount s right to serve arguablytracks its incorporated limits, whatever they might be.  (Jonathan and Iarelooking at annexation law to see what else might be lurking out there).The 1992 Service agreement provides, In Article IV, provides that points ofdevliery for all natural gas purchased or transported under the agreementwith NCNG shall be ""at the following locations and other stations added atmutually agreeable locations in the future. . ."" In the Third Amendment tothe Natural Gas Service Agreement, dated March 10, 1997, new language anddelivery points are negotiated upon, but the principle is still includedthat  other stations may be added at ""mutually agreeable locations in thefuture.""  The question which then arises is what Rocky Mount would have togive in exchange.  In the 1997 agreement, Rocky Mount agreed to anextentionof terms of the of ten years, until December 6,"

PG&E admits that they transferred accumulated credit balances off of the residential accounts BEFORE they calculated the final direct access bill.  The final bills were all debit amounts due to the rate increases and the new procured energy credit calculations.  PG&E then transferred these debit balances on to the customers  first utility bill.  We found out this had happened when we received calls from angry customers who had received disconnect notices.  They had been told by PG&E that Enron had refused to pay the final bills.  My guess is that most customers paid the balances rather than risk disconnection.I requested a list of all credit balances transferred from PG&E so we can do an analysis of how much money is involved.  However, I have not sent a written request.  I thought I should confer with you before I send any formal request.We also have an issue with SCE.  They are transferring debit balances  to residential customers for service PRIOR to direct access.   If you recall, their argument for not reinstating prior balances was that they consider these new accounts.  If that is indeed their process, this is inconsistent."

Hopefully this message willreach you with no problems.I hope this message finds you both very well!  As you may recall, I will beworking for McKinsey and Company in Seattle starting this fall.  However, myinterest in energy has continued to grow since Wharton s Tiger Team projectwith Enron last spring, and I decided to spend the second half of my summerworking in the industry.I am currently serving as interim Marketing Manager for e-Acumen, a venture-backed provider of high-end analytics, software, and advisory services tofinancial services companies trading weather derivatives and re-insurersdealing in catastrophic weather risk policies, as well as to power and energyindustry clients.  Our primary investor is GE Power Systems, while some of ourother investors include Woodside Fund, Perseus Capital, CreateLabs, andNewVista Capital.I represent the Weather Risk Services group, which provides consensus weatherforecasts--forecasts that consistently beat the National Weather ServiceMedium Range Forecast model--to financial, power and energy industry clients,of which Enron is one. In addition, the group provides load forecasts to manyof the largest power traders in the country.e-Acumen s newest product, WeatherAcumen, is a quantitative weather riskplatform based on leading edge portfolio optimization analytics and simulationtechniques.  WeatherAcumen mitigates weather risk by more accuratelydetermining intrinsic values of weather derivatives, and features proprietaryapplications of a non-parametric Monte Carlo simulation engine that provideshigh fidelity indications of statistical arbitrage opportunities, resulting inmore profitable hedging and trading strategies.A WeatherAcumen demonstration is scheduled for September 14 with Mark Tawney,head of the weather desk, as well as Claudio Ribeiro, Joe Hrgovcic, andMichael Nguyen.   While they will be considering the functional benefits ofsuch a platform to Enron s weather operations, I wanted to discuss a longer-term partnership opportunity with you that could benefit Enron from amarketing and profitability standpoint.One possible model for collaboration could involve e-Acumen providing a directlink from the WeatherAcumen platform to EnronOnline in order to driveincreased trading volume to your site.  WeatherAcumen s superior analytics,industry-leading weather backcasts and forecasts, and proprietary simulationtechnology allow weather derivatives, power, and gas traders to have greaterprice-discovery capabilities.  Even better, firms trading with a WeatherAcumen-enabled counterparty will have more confidence in posted prices, and thus bemore willing to trade on your site.  We feel that such a partnership couldvery beneficial to both Enron and e-Acumen.I would appreciate the opportunity to talk with you in person. Please let meknow if there is a convenient time to call you to discuss how we mightcollaborate with Enron.  Thank you very much, and I look forward to thepossibility of working with you again.Very best regards,Heather ThorneMarketing Manager, e-Acumen"

Because text has been rearranged and several provisions have been substantially reworded, the version of this agreement marked against the prior version is not particularly helpful, but I am happy to provide one if you wish.  Please note that I am the only one on the Enron working group that has seen this revised draft; it therefore remains subject to comments by the other members of the team.  Instead of providing a redline, I thought it would be helpful to review the most substantive changes in this e-mail.  Please feel free to give me a call with any comments or questions.1. As I have discussed with Stephen, you should not assume that we have rejected any of your comments if they did not appear in the attached version.   Please contact me to discuss, or resend, any comments that you believe that we accepted but that are not reflected in this document.2. Several new defined terms have been added.  Several definitions were revised to reflect that eSpeed will be posting prices to a platform operated by a separate legal entity that eSpeed will not necessarily control.3. The defined terms ""Sponsor Material Adverse Effect"", ""Sponsor Regulatory Event"", and ""Sponsor Technological Failure"" have been renamed ""eSpeed ..."" instead of ""Sponsor ...""4. Sections 3(a) and (b) have been slightly reworded to reflect the multiple platform concept.   Section 3(c) was moved from Section 5.  The standards for a party s right to suspend have been revised slightly.  Also, Section 4(d) includes a right by Enron to suspend prices specifically in the event of mapping errors; this provision also relates to the termination right in Section 13 with respect to mapping errors. 5. Section 4 has been rewritten to reflect the multiple platforms.     6. Section 5(b) has been revised to reflect that the parties should develop a set of ground rules for operating and maintaining the Interfaces that will govern the parties once they commence operations.7. Section 6 has not been changed in any significant manner, except for Section 6(d) with respect to commissions8. Section 7 has been moved (it was previously Section 9) and reflects our concerns that the means by which contracts are entered into with Enron are clearly disclosed to Participants.9. The parity section has been revised as we discussed -- essentially, Enron shall use ""commercially reasonable efforts to ensure parity""  10. The reps and warranties and covenants have not been substantively revised, but separate reps, warranties and covenants are made by each party (instead of including both parties reps/warranties/covenants in the same provision).11. Section 12 is new.  We felt that the Agreement did not clearly set forth what would have to be done before the parties could start posting prices.12. We have revised Section 13(a)(i) and (iii) and 13(b)(i) and (iii) (termination events as we discussed); 13(a)(ii) and (b)(ii) are new. 13. Section 14 has been substantially revised, but is still confusing,  However, the idea is that the agreement include a single provision governing confidentiality and that certain information that Enron is particularly sensitive about will be kept confidential, while other information becomes eSpeed s property at some point to do with as it wishes.  Any thoughts about clarifying Section 14 would be appreciated.14. The Indemnity has been revised to include a separate section for each party ((a) and (b)), but we do not believe that the substance of the prior provision was changed.15. We need to give further thought to Section 16 and the provisions that eSpeed provided to us (Sections 15(e), (f) and (g) in the prior draft).  While I have discussed this with Stephen and do not object to the point that those provisions is trying to make, the language is a bit broad in places and we need to spend more time with it to make sure that it does not conflict with other provisions of the Agreement.16. I have tried to reserve the right for the parties to obtain injunctive relief, but this section needs expansion -- and I think Stephen had some specific thoughts about what would not be subject to arbitration.17. The Enron Covenant added as Exhibit H is not perfect, but it is essentially what we had contemplated providing.  The Schedule A listing Specified Products is also attached.  Therefore, the only Exhibit or Schedule missing is Exhibit I, which is the commission structure. Please feel free to call or send a message if you have any comments or questions regarding the atttached.

Interns that came in through this Rice program did not go through the normal campus interviews by the A/A Program.  The A/A Program would recommend that Sheila go through a round of Super Saturday interviews just like all other Analyst off-cycle candidates.  This would allow other top Enron people to review Sheila and evaluate her skill level.  With that said, I believe that Jennifer thinks highly of this individual and the A/A Program could forgo the interviews it you agree to take Sheila in your group for the first rotation.  Please confirm that you would like Sheila to be made an offer from the A/A Program and that you will accept her in one of the EGM groups upon graduation.

Sheila was a summer analysts in the Middle Marketing group. She was part of the Rice Leadership Program. I have served as Sheila s mentor in this program, which seeks to provide business internships for non-business majors. I believe that programs such as this and their candidates are essential to Enron as they provide a pool of academically diverse, bright individuals who can think outside the box.Sheila managed our EnronOnline Top 200 Natural Gas Users Project. She was instrumental in ensuring the success of this project. By the time Sheila left, we had signed up over 70% of the top US industrial natural gas consumers. Sheila is an exceptionally quick study, as evidenced by her rapid grasp of key derivative concepts and structures. Every week Sheila priced the swaps and options for our customer newsletters. She also priced and helped develop several customized structures for our clients. Finally, Sheila demonstrated and exceptional work ethic that combined with all her other attributes places her among the top summer analysts at Enron. I believe Sheila should receive a full-time job offer from the program. She graduates in May 2001. I am also prepared to offer Sheila a rotation in my group in Global Markets upon her graduation.If you need any further information, please let me know.Thank you for your assistance with this matter.Jen Fraser"

deliver,"As you may know by now, Congress has adjourned without extending the PTC (see attached).  The Democrats would not support any extenders bill as leverage to get a Stimulus Package passed and everything died.  The Speaker has asked the President to call Congress back on Jan 2 to debate the Stimulus Package, but that seems unlikely. The best we can now hope for is that Congress takes up PTC either as part of the Stimulus Package or an Energy Bill in Feb/March  02.  For the wind co, this is good and bad.  The good is that while the Enron BK has kept customers away, at least now none of our competitors can book orders either.  My hope is that PTC extension and the announcement of a new owner for EW will happen about the same time.  The bad news is that it means our US business will be further hurt - a 200 unit  02 is now out of reach and a 100-125 unit year may be the best we can hope for (assuming the PTC is extended in Q1).  (Maybe the Candover folks knew something we didn t, although I doubt it).  For sale purposes, we will run our  02 numbers at 150 units and put as positive a spin on it for bidders as we can.  Bottom line is that  02 will be a break-even to small profit year for us in the US.Stan - we are in the process of revising our financial projections for a teaser to be sent out to bidders next week and this news will be reflected in those projections (meaning that the sale projections will now differ slightly from what we submitted to Enron earlier this week).  Also, we have launched reductions in force in the US.  I will reduce our MFG workforce by around 85 right after the first of the year and expect to have to let another 100-150 go early in Q1.  I will keep you posted.

House Majority Leader Dick Armey refused to let the Extenders Package come to the House floor because he felt it wouls demonstrate to the Senate Democrats that the House Republicans were not serious about the Stimulus Package. Armey and Bill Thomas got into a shouting match on the floor as Thomas tried to get Armey to move the bill. Thomas and Rangel (the ranking Democrat on Ways and Means) had agreed on a one year extension which is also what the Senate Republicans would agree to.This is partisan politics at its worst. There were no valid public policy reasons to not pass an extenders package Our only option at this point is to go back in January and try to get the extenders passed. They will be looking at an Economic Stimulus Package again if the economic conditions don t improve. There are 15 expiring provisions in the current bill so we will have alot of other groups fighting for extenders.My apologies to all of you. I am devasted by this turn of events.Hap"

deliver,"Judge orders Enron to deliver electricity to universitiesUpdated: April 11, 2001 - 2:06 p.m. SAN FRANCISCO -- Saying that Enron Energy Systems Inc. may be in breach of contract, a federal judge Wednesday ordered the Houston company to abide by its agreement to sell cheap power to the state s public universities. Enron was attempting to get out of delivering power for the final year of a four-year deal with the California State University and University of California systems. Enron, which buys power from producers and sells it on the market, said the contract would cost the energy concern $12 million a month because of skyrocketing wholesale power prices. Enron said the state should free Enron from its obligation and taxpayers should pick up the tab. ""It s our economic interest to provide a service with the least amount of dollars we can provide it for,"" Enron attorney A. William Urquhart said. He later described the case as being ""all about money. It s all about money."" Enron said it would file an emergency appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to overturn U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton s ruling in the suit brought by the state s two university systems. Appearing in federal court, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer argued that Enron wants out of the contract so it can engage in a ""marketing game"" with the universities  promised power and sell it on the open market for 10 times more than what the electricity cost Enron. He said lawmakers may have ""left the keys in the car"" when they approved California s failed energy deregulation scheme that has prompted the energy crisis, ""But it is still theft to steal the car."" The judge issued a temporary injunction against Enron, forcing it to continue providing service as the suit brought by the universities proceeds. When the judge issued the order, she also said there is a likelihood Enron will lose the suit. ""I am persuaded, in the end, there is a very strong likelihood of success on the breach of contract claim,"" the judge said. UC s annual electric bill is about $87 million and its natural gas bill is about $26 million. CSU annually pays about $40 million for electricity and $20 million for natural gas. The case is UC Regents vs. Enron Energy Systems Inc., 01-1006. -- Associated Press"

They are as follows:1.  Proposed Rule 91-504 - Over-The-Counter Derivatives (""91-504"") and the==20corresponding companion policy have yet to be formally adopted.  At this=20time, 91-504 is merely a proposal.  In addition to checking the Ontario=20Securities Commission (""OSC"") website, I have contacted the lawyer who firs=t=20brought the ""securities representation"" issue to our attention and he has==20confirmed that 91-504 is not yet in place and there have been no recent=20announcements by the OSC with respect to an anticipated timeline for such==20adoption.2.  Even though the WCL may trade through an office in Toronto, any trade==20with Enron Canada Corp. (""Enron Canada"") is likely to be considered a ""trad=e=20within Alberta"" under Alberta securities law (due to the fact that the head==20office and the mind and management of Enron Canada are in Alberta).  As a==20result, it is important that we get representations which address Alberta==20securities law.3.  In a similar vein to point number 2 above, a ""trade"" can take place in =a=20number of jurisdictions depending upon the particular facts of the trade. ==20Although it may seem unlikely, it is possible that trades could possibly be==20made in jurisdictions other than Alberta and Ontario.  With the exception o=f=20British Columbia, I am not aware of other provinces of Canada adopting=20similar ""blanket orders"", ""policies"" or ""rules"" with respect to this issue.= =20However, it is usually Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia which are at t=he=20forefront of Canadian securities law development (with the remaining=20jurisdictions eventually following the leaders).   I expect that, once 91-5=04=20is in place, we will see some movement from the remaining jurisdictions. ==20Regardless, it would seem prudent to leave the reference to British Columbi=a=20in place at this time.4.  I think it is worthwhile to have the parties to the ISDA acknowledge th=e=20fact that a transaction under the ISDA will constitute an ""OTC Derivative""==20(and thus, have the applicable prospectus and registration exemptions=20potentially available to them).  I can think of no reason why it would be==20beneficial to either party to remove this representation.With respect to our physical agreements, we have addressed points 1, 2 and =3=20above (as well as the fact that the exemptions we are relying upon are=20provided by blanket orders and policies {as opposed to the Securities Act==20(Alberta), Securities Act (British Columbia) or Securities Act (Ontario)} a=nd=20are, thus, more likely to be {and more easily} amended) with the following==20clause:""(i) each Transaction shall constitute a =01&commodity contract=018 or an ==01&OTC=20derivative=018 or such other similar term as defined pursuant to the securi=ties=20legislation in force in Alberta or British Columbia or pursuant to the=20securities legislation of any other jurisdictions having application to the==20Transaction, and (ii) it is a =01&Qualified Party=018 within the meaning of==20paragraph 9.1 of Alberta Securities Commission Order Doc.#394043 and=20paragraph 1.1 of the British Columbia Securities Commission Blanket Order==20BOR#91-501, in either case, as amended, restated, replaced or re-enacted fr=om=20time to time, and pursuant to any equivalent order or other enactment made==20pursuant to the securities laws of Alberta, British Columbia or any other==20jurisdictions having application to the Transaction;""I understand that similar language has not been adopted in the ISDA due to==20the ""open-ended"" nature of the above-mentioned clause.  If we want to refer==20to 91-504 and only to the blanket orders and policies currently in place, I==20would suggest that we amend the existing clause, which states:Canadian Securities Acts.  (i) Each Transaction shall constitute an =01&OTC==20Derivative=018 as defined in the Securities Act (Alberta) and the Securitie=s Act=20(British Columbia) which have application to such Transaction and (ii) it i=s=20a =01&Qualified Party=018 within the meaning of paragraph 9.1 of Alberta Se=curities=20Commission Order Doc#394043 and/or paragraph 1.1 of the British Columbia=20Securities Commission Blanket Order BOR#91-501(BC), as in effect on the dat=e=20hereof.to:Canadian Securities Legislation.

Lawyers for the other plaintiffs will begin tomorrow.? Izower was a first-year lawyer at White & Case when he began working on the NSM offering in Oct. 1997.? The senior White & Case lawyers who worked on the deal have either changed firms or retired.Highlights: --Hatch spent much of the morning on the off-take agreements and their description in the offering memo.? Izower strongly defended offering memo s description of the off-take agreements as accurate but would not cooperate with Hatch when asked to point out where in the off-take agreements Preussag or Klockner were ""obligated"" to purchase NSM s steel.? Izower s counsel objected to the questions as calling for a legal conclusion.? --Hatch walked Izower through the various drafts of the off-take agreements and asked if Izower had discussed the changes with the ""underwriting group.""? Izower testified that most of the comments were received from Gleacher Natwest, McDonald, Cravath and SDI.? Izower produced a responsibility schedule concerning certain documents related to the offering with completion dates.? Enron/ECT is not mentioned in the document as having had any role in the drafting although Izower did mention, as an afterthought, that Enron and Paine Webber may also have provided comments on the off-take agreements.--Hatch established that the offering memo failed to disclose the existence of certain material agreements such as: a)????? Employment agreements between NSM and Swasdi Horrungruang and NSM and Chamni Janchai (who was thought of as being a crook) pursuant to which they received an annual salary of $350,000 for ten years;b)????? A Throughput Agreement between Sriracha Harbor and NSM pursuant to which NSM offering proceeds would be diverted to the Harbor (which Swasdi had an ownership interest in) and to certain Thai banks who were owed sums from the Harbor.? Apparently, the Thai banks were threatening a foreclosure and take over of the Harbor jeopardizing NSM s ability to import and export materials.? The payment sums are not disclosed.? In less than convincing fashion, Izower indicated that the agreement was probably not mentioned in the offering memo as it may not have qualified as ""related party transaction.""--Izower had no idea why the legal, financial and advisory fees on the NSM deal had increased from $29 million to $35 million.This e-mail message may contain legally privileged and/or confidential information.

Sorry for the mixed signals.  al>>> ""Howard J. Weg"" <hweg@pgwlaw.com> 08/28/01 09:35PM >>>I have not heard back from all members of the Unofficial Committee regardingmy email dated August 27, 2001 with respect to the proposal to contact theGovernor and Legislators regarding the pending legislation on SCE.Some have suggested that the message needs to be stronger and others havesuggested that the message is too strong.  Our Ex Officio members BPA andWAPA want it to be clear that they are not involved in any way withaddressing the state government on this or other issues.  As you know, Iwant very much to reach as broad of a consensus on this action as ispossible, and to protect the interests of all members.Virtually all members agree that a bankruptcy case for or litigation againstSCE would probably not be a good thing and we do not want to advocate forbankruptcy or litigation.  After all, the Unofficial Committee was organizedto provide a different approach generally.  The purpose of contacting theGovernor and the Legislature is to let them know that the legislation theyare now considering, which leaves SCE about $1 billion short on the proposedfinancing to pay creditors, may cause some other sellers to take precipitousaction in filing an involuntary petitition or initiating litigation orarbitration that could delay or prevent the financing at even the lower $2.9billion level, which will adversly affect SCE and all creditors generally.We should point out that not all sellers are in agreement on what actionwill be taken. The message is not intended to threaten anything and it isnot necessarily designed to stop legislation altogether, only legislationthat might actually make the situation worse for all sellers and SCE.The tone of the presentation, if we make one, will be low key, nonthreatening, and in the spirit of helping the legislature and the Governordesign a package that will avoid the bankruptcy, litigation and otheralternatives that others might be forced to consider if the bill is passed,leaving the energy sellers out in the cold.If there remain some members of the Committee that are not willing to beassociated with the message outlined above, then I propose that we give suchmembers the alternative of remaining members of the Unofficial Committee andallowing us, if asked, to identify any such members that prefer not to be apart of the message although they want to support an approach that avoidslitigation and bankruptcy for SCE.  I understand that the LADWP and CoralPower would like this approach adopted.As I explained in my prior email, it has been suggested that the proposedbill that leaves SCE short by a billion dollars will likely pass after LaborDay and before the Sept 14 adjournment.  That is why timing is important.Those of you that have not responed, please respond.  Those of you that wereconcerned that the message was unclear, please review this email andconsider or reconsider your positions, as the case may be.As of right now, there are only 11 votes: 9 in favor and 2 against.  Thepolls are still open so please let me know your position.You should be aware that the City of Glendale notified me that it determinedthat actual or potential conflicts of interest with the Unofficial Committeerequired it to resign from the Unofficial Committee."

Byron assured me that he would stop the type of press like the article you sent.  He reiterated although that El Paso has had good success in dealing with the government in a very private way and did not want to publicise any differences that they may have with the government from time to time.  He was willing to stop the press articles that defined differences between El Paso and Enron in their approach to Brazil but had no desire to join Enron in publically trying to effectuate change in Brazil.  The meeting was very friendly.  Let me know if I can be of further help.Hope all is well with you and you and your family.

deliver,"Good Morning! Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month. For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston s low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight.

Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow.

(APXc), a leading provider of online markets for the electric power industry, today announced that John Yurkanin has joined APX as its new president and chief executive officer (CEO). Yurkanin, former chief operating officer of the California Power Exchange (CalPX), has two decades of experience in the energy industry, including oil, gas, and electric power. ``I am very pleased to be taking the helm of APX,   said Yurkanin. ``The APX approach - using the Internet to foster open and neutral markets for power trading and delivery - is just what the U.S. and international markets of today and tomorrow need. APX has assembled an exceptionally talented group of people who are developing the leading Internet-based marketplace for the electric power industry.   Yurkanin, a career energy industry executive, brings an international, multi-commodity perspective to his new role at APX, from his past roles at British Petroleum, Louisville Gas and Electric, and most recently CalPX. He had served as executive vice president and chief operating officer for the CalPX since December 1998 with responsibility for internal operations. This included all trading operations, market services, settlement operations, marketing, and information technology efforts. ``APX, as a provider of open markets, is an important part of the resolution of California s volatile electricity market, as well as aiding other deregulating markets around the globe,   said Yurkanin. ``This is important not only on a regional, but also on a global level, for the lessons being learned in California will shape the course of markets around the world. In joining APX, I am able to bring my recent public sector experience back into the private sector, where I have spent most of my career.   Prior to joining CalPX, Yurkanin served as Louisville Gas and Electric Energy Corp. s (LG&E) senior vice president for marketing and operations in its non-regulated businesses with responsibility for operating assets associated with the 24-hour power operations and gas control facilities. He also directed LG&E s retail marketing, regulatory strategy, and products and services development for emerging power and gas markets. Yurkanin also was a principal in two energy consulting firms for two years after his lengthy tenure with British Petroleum (BP), which extended from 1981 until 1994. At BP, he advanced through a number of positions associated with crude oil trading, and North American and European oil and gas marketing. From 1992 to 1994, he served as vice president for BP Gas, with responsibilities for the start-up of U.S. commodity marketing and trading operations to manage BP s equity production of gas and liquid hydrocarbons. Richard Amen, who had served as APX CEO since May 2000, will resume his role as managing partner of Venture Management Associates (VMA), which provides investment capital and management assistance for rapidly growing technology companies. Yurkanin earned a master of business administration, with emphasis in finance and management, from Xavier University of Ohio, and holds a bachelor of science degree in chemistry from the University of Cincinnati. About Automated Power Exchange Automated Power Exchange operates Internet-based markets for the buying and selling of electric power, renewable power, and related products and provides the market and scheduling technologies needed to support power system administration. A privately held company with approximately 100 employees, APX has its world headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif., and its European headquarters in London.

""My Daddy,"" he said,""pretends to be people."" There have been quite a few of them.Prophets from the Old and New Testaments, a couple ofChristian saints, generals of various nationalities and differentcenturies, several kings, three American presidents, a Frenchcardinal and two geniuses, including Michelangelo. If you want theceiling re-painted I ll do my best. There always seem to be a lotof different fellows up here. I m never sure which one of them getsto talk. Right now, I guess I m the guy.As I pondered our visit tonight it struck me: If my creator gave methe gift to connect you with the hearts and minds of thosegreat men, then I want to use that same gift now to re-connect youwith your own sense of liberty ... your own freedom ofthought ... your own compass for what is right. Dedicating thememorial at Gettysburg, Abraham Lincoln said of America, ""We arenow engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether this nation orany nation so conceived and so dedicated can longendure."" Those words are true again. I believe that we are againengaged in a great civil war, a cultural war that s about tohijack your birthright to think and say what resides in your heart.I fear you no longer trust the pulsing lifeblood of liberty insideyou ... the stuff that made this country rise from wilderness intothe miracle that it is.Let me back up. About a year ago I became president of the NationalRifle Association, which protects the right to keep andbear arms. I ran for office, I was elected, and now I serve ... Iserve as a moving target for the media who ve called meeverything from ""ridiculous"" and ""duped"" to a ""brain-injured,senile, crazy old man."" I know ... I m pretty old ... but I surethank the Lord ain t senile. As I have stood in the crosshairs ofthose who target Second Amendment freedoms, I ve realized thatfirearms are not the only issue. No, it s much, much bigger thanthat. I ve come to understand that a cultural war is raging acrossour land, in which, with Orwellian fervor, certain acceptablethoughts and speech are mandated.For example, I marched for civil rights with Dr. King in 1963 --long before Hollywood found it fashionable. But when I told anaudience last year that white pride is just as valid as black prideor red pride or anyone else s pride, they called me a racist.I ve worked with brilliantly talented homosexuals all my life. Butwhen I told an audience that gay rights should extend nofurther than your rights or my rights, I was called a homophobe.I served in World War II against the Axis powers. But during aspeech, when I drew an analogy between singling out innocent Jewsand singling out innocent gun owners, I was called an anti-Semite.Everyone I know knows I would never raise a closed fist against mycountry. But when I asked an audience to oppose thiscultural persecution, I was compared to Timothy McVeigh.>From Time magazine to friends and colleagues, they re essentiallysaying, ""Chuck, how dare you speak your mind. You areusing language not authorized for public consumption!""But I am not afraid. If Americans believed in politicalcorrectness, we d still be King George s boys-subjects bound to theBritish crown.In his book, ""The End of Sanity,"" Martin Gross writes that""blatantly irrational behavior is rapidly being established as thenorm in almost every area of human endeavor. There seem to be newcustoms, new rules, new anti-intellectual theories regularlyfoisted on us from every direction.Underneath, the nation is roiling. Americans know something,without a name is undermining the nation, turning the mindmushy when it comes to separating truth from falsehood and rightfrom wrong. And they don t like it.""Let me read a few examples. At Antioch college in Ohio, young menseeking intimacy with a coed must get verbal permission at eachstep of the process from kissing to petting to final copulation ...all clearly spelled out in a printed college directive. In NewJersey, despite the death of several patients nationwide who hadbeen infected by dentists who had concealed their AIDS --- thestate commissioner announced that health providers who areHIV-positive need not. .. need not ... tell their patients thatthey are infected.At William and Mary, students tried to change the name of theschool team ""The Tribe"" because it was supposedly insultingto local Indians, only to learn that authentic Virginia chiefstruly like the name.In San Francisco, city fathers passed an ordinance protecting therights of transvestites to cross-dress on the job, and fortranssexuals to have separate toilet facilities while undergoingsex change surgery.In New York City, kids who don t speak a word of Spanish have beenplaced in bilingual classes to learn their three R s inSpanish solely because their last names sound Hispanic. At theUniversity of Pennsylvania, in a state where thousands diedat Gettysburg opposing slavery, the president of that collegeofficially set up segregated dormitory space for black students.Yeah, I know ... that s out of bounds now. Dr. King said ""Negroes.""Jimmy Baldwin and most of us on the March said ""black."" But it s ano-no now.For me, hyphenated identities are awkward ... particularly""Native-American."" I m a Native American, for God s sake. I alsohappen to be a blood-initiated brother of the Miniconjou Sioux. Onmy wife s side, my grandson is a 13th-generation Native American... with a capital letter on ""American."" Finally, just last month... David Howard, head of the Washington D.C. Office of PublicAdvocate, used the word ""niggardly"" while talking to colleaguesabout budgetary matters. Of course,  niggardly  means stingy orscanty. But within days Howard was forced to publicly apologize andresign.As columnist Tony Snow wrote: ""David Howard got fired because somepeople in public employ were morons who (a) didn t know the meaningof  niggardly,  (b) didn t know how to use a dictionary to discoverthe meaning, and ,actually demanded that he apologize for theirignorance."" What does all of this mean? It means that telling uswhat to think has evolved into telling us what to say, so tellingus what to do can t be far behind.Before you claim to be a champion of free thought, tell me: Why didpolitical correctness originate on America s campuses?And why do you continue to tolerate it? Why do you, who re supposedto debate ideas, surrender to their suppression?Let s be honest. Who here thinks your professors can say what theyreally believe? It scares me to death, and should scareyou too, that the superstition of political correctness rules thehalls of reason.You are the best and the brightest. You, here in the fertile cradleof American academia, here in the castle of learning on theCharles River, you are the cream. But I submit that you, and yourcounterparts across the land, are the most sociallyconformed and politically silenced generation since Concord Bridge.And as long as you validate that ... and abide it ... you are-byyour grandfathers  standards-cowards.Here s another example. Right now at more than one majoruniversity, Second Amendment scholars and researchers arebeing told to shut up about their findings or they ll lose theirjobs. Why? Because their research findings would underminebig-city mayor s pending lawsuits that seek to extort hundreds ofmillions of dollars from firearm manufacturers.I don t care what you think about guns. But if you are not shockedat that, I am shocked at you. Who will guard the rawmaterial of unfettered ideas, if not you? Who will defend the corevalue of academia, if you supposed soldiers of free thoughtand expression lay down your arms and plead, ""Don t shoot me."" Ifyou talk about race, it does not make you a racist. If yousee distinctions between the genders, it does not make you asexist. If you think critically about a denomination, it does notmake you anti-religion. If you accept but don t celebratehomosexuality, it does not make you a homophobe.Don t let America s universities continue to serve as incubatorsfor this rampant epidemic of new McCarthyism. But what can you do?How can anyone prevail against such pervasive social subjugation?The answer s been here all along. I learned it 36 years ago, on thesteps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C.,standing with Dr. Martin Luther King and two hundred thousandpeople. You simply ... disobey. Peaceably, yes. Respectfully, ofcourse. Nonviolently, absolutely. But when told how to think orwhat to say or how to behave, we don t. We disobey social protocolthat stifles and stigmatizes personal freedom.I learned the awesome power of disobedience from Dr. King ... wholearned it from Gandhi, and Thoreau and Jesus and every other greatman who led those in the right against those with the might.Disobedience is in our DNA. We feel innate kinship with thatDisobedient spirit that tossed tea into Boston Harbor, that sentThoreau to jail, that refused to sit in the back of the bus, thatprotested a war in Vietnam.In that same spirit, I am asking you to disavow culturalcorrectness with massive disobedience of rogue authority, socialdirectives and onerous law that weaken personal freedom.But be careful ... it hurts. Disobedience demands that you putyourself at risk. Dr. King stood on lots of balconies. You mustbe willing to be humiliated ... to endure the modern-day equivalentof the police dogs at Montgomery and the water Cannons at Selma.You must be willing to experience discomfort. I m not Complaining,but my own decades of social activism have taken their toll on me.Let me tell you a story.A few years back I heard about a rapper named Ice-T who was sellinga CD called ""Cop Killer"" celebrating ambushing andmurdering police officers. It was being marketed by none other thanTime/Warner, the biggest entertainment conglomerate in the world.Police across the country were outraged. Rightfully so-at least onehad been murdered. But Time/Warner wasstonewalling because the CD was a cash cow for them, and the mediawere tiptoeing around it because the rapper was black.I heard Time/Warner had a stockholders meeting scheduled in BeverlyHills. I owned some shares at the time, so I decided to attend.What I did there was against the advice of my family andcolleagues. I asked for the floor. To a hushed room of athousand average American stockholders, I simply read the fulllyrics of ""Cop Killer""-every vicious, vulgar, instructional word.""I GOT MY 12 GAUGE SAWED OFFI GOT MY HEADLIGHTS TURNED OFFI m ABOUT TO BUST SOME SHOTS OFFI m ABOUT TO DUST SOME COPS OFF...""It got worse, a lot worse. I won t read the rest of it to you. Buttrust me, the room was a sea of shocked, frozen, blanchedfaces. The Time/Warner executives squirmed in their chairs andstared at their shoes. They hated me for that.Then I delivered another volley of sick lyric brimming with racistfilth, where Ice-T fantasizes about sodomizing two 12-year oldnieces of Al and Tipper Gore. ""SHE PUSHED HER BUTT AGAINST MY ....""Well, I won t do to you here what I did to them. Let s just say Ileft the room in echoing silence.When I read the lyrics to the waiting press corps, one of them said""We can t print that."" ""I know,"" I replied, ""but Time/Warner _sselling it.""Two months later, Time/Warner terminated Ice-T s contract. I llnever be offered another film by Warners, or get a good review fromTime magazine. But disobedience means you must be willing to act,not just talk.When a mugger sues his elderly victim for defending herself ... jamthe switchboard of the district attorney s office. When youruniversity is pressured to lower standards until 80 percent of thestudents graduate with honors ... choke the halls of the board ofregents. When an 8-year-old boy pecks a girl s cheek on theplayground and gets hauled into court for sexual harassment...march on that school and block its doorways.When someone you elected is seduced by political power and betraysyou ... petition them, oust them, banish them. WhenTime magazine s cover portrays millennium nuts as deranged, crazyChristians holding a cross as it did last month ... boycotttheir magazine and the products it advertises.So that this nation may long endure, I urge you to follow in thehallowed footsteps of the great disobediences of history thatfreed exiles, founded religions, defeated tyrants, and yes, in thehands of an aroused rabble in arms and a few great men, byGod s grace, built this country.If Dr. King were here, I think he would agree.Thank you. - att1.htm"

deliver,"I am forwarding the text of a response I received from Gisele Rankin,attorney for the Publilc Staff, to my inquiry regarding the security ofinformation submitted to the Commission under seal.  It largely tracks ourunderstanding and analysis.  The following are her words:""To my knowledge, no one has challenged anything filed with theCommission under seal pursuant to the trade secret statute.  Under thatstatute, if you want the information claimed to be a trade secret, youhave to go to court and carry the burden (and my recollection fromreading the statute is that it is a very high burden).  The only otherway it could be made public would be for the Commission to order it tobe made public (because it isn t a trade secret), which to my knowledgehas never happened with anything even remotely of commercial value andeven then the owner of the information could go to court to stop it.Costs related to generation are the most obviously ""trade secret"" typeinformation with which we deal. None of the utilities would try to claimit isn t protected, because then they would have to reveal theirinformation.  CUCA could try to get it in order to participate in thehearing, but CUCA generally supports IPP development (in general), andJamie would have to sign a nondisclosure agreement and not reveal theinformation to anyone.  For all practical purposes, Enron is safe.(Even if a claim were made, Enron could tie it up until the informationwas so old it was worth much less, if anything.)"""

Fred Kahn, Al Philipps, Bill Hogan and a number of other distinguished academics will be reviewing our progress and the prospects for the future.  The conference will take place at a beautiful site in the Poconos, about 90 minutes north of Philadelphia, from Wednesday afternoon May 24th to Friday afternoon May 26th.  You can check for yourself the nature of the program and the conference site/hotel at the following website URL:http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~crri/WS.htmMichael Crew and I would both be delighted if you would be willing to be an after dinner speaker on Thursday evening (May 25th), just before the key research reviews of Friday morning take place on the electricity, telephone and gas industries, and following a day of special topics on emerging power markets and other developments in network industries.   Naturally we would be pleased if you would be able to stay for the entire conference, but knowing your schedule, you may only have time for a part of it.  That would not be a problem.  The usual after-dinner address is for 30 minutes, followed by a short Q&A period.Your presentation would help to underline the tremendous importance of Enron in driving the development of new risk instruments to assist in price discovery and efficient risk management for market participants, in energy markets and more generally.  Both Michael and I feel that your perspectives on the ""new science of risk management"" and what can be expected from it could be a very important addition to this special anniversay event.Please let me know (and please do copy Michael on your response) whether your schedule will allow your participation in this very special event.

However, the attorney also agreed to the fact that they do use the name ""Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company"" eversince the name change happened. He said they had been using both names ""contractually"" and interchangeably even though it is all just ONE company, one state registered company.I m currently waiting on name change documents, however this is what it looks like thats going to happen:The main HQ company would end up being NICOR GAS COMPANY with all the trades/contracts/deals being merged into one record.

If the counterparty is not set up this way it need to be.Physical gas has a master in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company.There is no master agreement in place with Nicor Gas Company and the only trading being done with this entity is online gas trading.The issue that needs to be resolved is whether we want to trade gas under both Northern Illinois Gas Company and Nicor Gas Company.  Frank Davis will resolve this issue with Tom Moran in Credit and Stacy Dickson with physical gas Legal, and they will let us know who we should be trading with.When we hear back from them we can finally resolve what counterparty names we want to set up and get back to the counterparty if we have not received the correct Password Application to match out intended trading partners.Sorry for all the confusion this is causing.

deliver,"Hi Rusty, Since Carlos is working on the Pontiac and Plano sale, I m going to forward this to him for his handling.  That way things will stay better organized.Thanks,KayRusty Stevens02/26/2001 10:45 AMTo: Kathleen Carnahan/NA/Enron@Enron, Kay Mann/Corp/Enron@Enroncc: Fred Mitro/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ben Jacoby/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Pontiac Land OptionOur current land option on the Pontiac site goes to June 11th, with a 6 month extension for $5000.  In order to enhance and maintain the value of the site (we re trying to sell it now) I have gotten Ben s authorization to secure an additional 12 month extension on the deal for $10,000.I spoke to the landowner - Dick Greene - and he indicated that they would consider it, although he has never been in favor of an option structure since  he is 80 years old and just wants the money from the sale.  The concept I pitched today was that we would pay them for the 6 month extension, and give them an additional $5000 now in exchange for adding another 12 month extension on the back.  At the time we exercise that 12 month extension we would pay them another $5000.  He said he would have to hear what his lawyer said in this regard, but I think its close to a deal.  Perhaps we could arrange a conference call with Karen Way at Piper-Rudnick as she has dealt extensively with their lawyer Ed Legner.  Its good timing to hit him now, since he does a lot of tax work so he will want to wrap us up quickly.As regards accounting issues, the total exercise price is 117 acres * $4500 / ac. = $526,500, and 5% = $26,325.  Total option premiums (including this extension I am proposing) will be $20,000.  I believe we may also need to amend the original option language to make it clear that the option fee is not part of the price."

They are apparently revisiting things there.  So here is my reaction to the APS filing, which I had not heard about.It is my recollection that the spin off is part of the entire-ball-of-wax settlement approved by the ACC for the APS restructuring in 10/99.  Therefore they must have filed to reopen this settlement (which was not to be allowed, of course).  The settlement, while ""opening"" markets, effectively keeps them closed for lack of headroom until 7/04 at the earliest.  So, if there is a commercial interest in AZ, then this filing could give us a chance to jump back in and make the arguments we made back in 99 that the settlement would not result in competition (and it didn t - time has proved us 100% correct on that) and if APS wants to change the settlement, then the non-competitive terms should be amended as well.That said, we do not get a great reception in AZ, and it is hard to say we would have any great chance of success.  The large customers do not mind that there is no competition because they have been on a mandated rate reduction path and saw none of the price run-ups that Californians and other westerners saw last winter (at least not yet).  We would have no one on our side.  SO, it is an opening, but I would let the commercial folks tell us how much it is worth to them, given the less than great odds. -----Original Message-----From: 	Nord, Sue  Sent:	Tuesday, October 23, 2001 3:53 PMTo:	Keene, Patrick; Lawner, LeslieSubject:	FW: APS Filing Is this something in which you think we should be engaged? -----Original Message-----From: 	Steffes, James D.

The October contract rose $0.107 to $3.232 per MMBtu. Tropica=l Storm Barry is expected to strengthen today and move into the north-centr=al Gulf of Mexico. Some weather forecasts expect that the storm will turn i=nto a hurricane, and the growing likelihood that workers will soon have to =be taken off Gulf of Mexico natural gas platforms has put traders on alert.= But, despite the storm risk, there was only limited short-covering and vol=ume was fairly light. However, strength in crude and products as well as Tr=opical Storm Barry encouraged buying by both trade, commercial accounts and= the locals. Fundamentally, the market is still bearish, but that could cha=nge quickly if the storm does impact production. Sell stops were triggered =as prices moved through the $3.20 level late in the session, bringing the m=arket off its highs. On Wednesday, the market dropped over $0.20 following =the release of AGA report data showing an injection of 77 Bcf last week. Ho=t weather is forecast for much of the nation early next week, with the West= Coast returning to hot weather next week. Natural gas for next day deliver=y across the US and Canada was generally $0.10 to $0.15 per MMBtu lower yes=terday, except out West where spot price climbed. Natural gas for next day =delivery at the Henry hub lost $0.17 to $3.15 per MMBtu.

The storm is most likely= to make landfall on Sunday in Louisiana. Companies with offshore productio=n have already taken steps to protect workers by moving them onshore until =the storm passes but they added that they had not yet suspended any product=ion. The National Hurricane Center forecasters predicts that Barry would mo=ve slowly to the northwest, taking it through the main producing areas of t=he central Gulf with a 55% chance that it would attain hurricane strength a=s it heads toward New Orleans. Chevron has evacuated 700 workers from offsh=ore platforms as a precaution against the storm and will make further evacu=ations today. The Gulf of Mexico provides about one quarter of nation s pro=duction of both natural gas and crude oil; about 13 Bcf of natural gas per =day and 1.4 million barrels of oil.=20--------------------------------------------------------              JUST COMPLETED - AVAILABLE NOW             NORTHEAST U.S. AND EASTERN CANADAZiff Energy Group s Multi-Client Study:Beyond the Midwest: Focusing on the Northeast Opportunities!Are you active in the US Northeast?

Public utilities which are loca=ted in competitive markets would no longer be bound by existing tax law str=ictly limiting private use of facilities financed with tax-exempt bonds. Ho=wever, they can continue to issue tax exempt financing for a limited amount= of generation to serve their own load, but not for service outside their l=ocal area. Private and public utilities say they are satisfied with the bil=l, nut private utilities are disappointed that the bill left out a provisio=n eliminating taxes on contributions in aid of construction. The bill inclu=des measures that allow public power systems to join RTOs in order to impro=ve the national transmission grid, without endangering outstanding bonds. T=he bill also makes an exception for prepaid natural gas contracts, which wo=uld apply only if at least 85% of the purchased volumes were for use by gov=ernmental utilities in the state where the bond issuer was located.=20-------------------------------------------------------- PNW 2001:Current Realities, Future ExpectationsPacific Northwest Gas Strategies ConferenceOctober 2,2001 Portland,Oregon (at the Hilton Portland)Hear Commissioner Wilson Condon, State of Alaska, describe how Alaska gas s=upply will energize the Pacific Northwest supply portfolio.

The California PUC claims that El Paso unfairly award=ed 1.2 Bcf per day of firm capacity to its affiliate, El Paso Merchant Ener=gy. Before the start of testimony, the FERC ALJ said that an April 2000 mem=orandum sent between Wise and another  official relates the minute details =of everything that is happening in the company, showing that Mr. Wise was w=ell aware of everything. That seems to run contrary to Wise s testimony at =the previous May  hearing, where testified he did not micromanage the affai=rs of El Paso s subsidiaries. The California PUC testified that El Paso awa=rded the capacity in question by skewing the rules of an open season, sayin=g it biased the open season in favor of the  total package  bid. If a singl=e bid for all of the capacity exceeded $37.5 million, then individual bids =could only succeed if they exceeded the value of the total package bid to E=l Paso.  Therefore, even if they submitted partial package bids at reasonab=ly high rates, their success was totally dependent upon the other partial p=ackage bids by other shippers. A total of 24 shippers submitted partial bid=s, and none of them were awarded any capacity, the PUC said. But El Paso di=sputed those claims, saying that it made the minimum economic criteria befo=re the open season, thus giving no one an advantage.=20--------------------------------------------------------                  YOU DESIGNED IT.

The Ladyfern are=a, located in an isolated section of northeastern British Columbia, is esti=mated to contain up to 1 Tcf. Murphy Oil and Apache jointly drilled the fir=st discovery well in the region a year ago, which is about 60 miles northea=st of the oil hub, Fort St. John, BC. Acreage in the Ladyfern region has so=ld for 17 times the median paid for acreage in other parts of BC. It is lik=ely second in size to the 1.8 Tcf Caroline, Alberta field in terms of Canad=ian onshore discoveries. Production is estimated at 480 MMcf per day. Canad=ian Natural is now producing 55 MMcf per day from one well, which is restri=cted by pipeline capacity. It expects to be producing 200 MMcf per day by t=he end of the year.

Whatever, but it is still another pie i=n the face the governor whose political viability seems to be fading almost= as fast as his friend, Gary Condit. Charges of conflict of interest surfac=ed last month as the Secretary of State called for a probe of consultants n=egotiating long-term energy deals designed to protect California from price= swings on the spot market. The governor fired five consultants last weeken=d after belatedly asking them to file required economic disclosure statemen=ts.

(E-mail)"" <richard.b.sanders@enron.com>		 cc: ""Meringolo, Peter"" <PMeringolo@brobeck.com>		 Subject: Some thoughts on optionsPRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIALATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGERichard, After today s discussion here are our brainstorming ideas onoptions:1.   WAIT FOR A BETTER PROTECTIVE ORDER Ask Harvey Morris where they are on fixing the protective order thatis being litigated by others.  If the protective order has not  changed,then unilaterally postpone production until it is.  Pro: Better protectionand more time; Con: Even with a more stringent protective order Enron still questions whether the PUC is entitledto financial performance data.  Thus, this option does not fullydisclose all of Enron s positions and the company may be accused later ofsimply engaging in delaying tactics.  Under this option  we file ourformal objections as well.2. TURN OVER THE TRANSACTION DATA AS IS Continue on our present course of turning over transaction data forelectricity that was delivered.  Pro: PUC will get the data  anywayeither through FERC, unfair competition, antitrust or price gouginglitigation.  By turning over the data that will show  profits, PUC mightslow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business byseeking to depose witnesses etc.  Con:  This would be waiving thelegitimate question that Enron has as to the PUC s ability to discovery thisinformation through a  subpoena.  There is also a question of howconfidential this data would be given the current political agenda.  Itmight also serve  to whet the appetite of the PUC for more Enroninformation and discovery.   This option would also provide confidentialproprietary information to the PUC about how Enron gets its competitiveadvantage.3. TURN OVER DATA FOR OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND LET PUC GET REST OFDATA FROM ISO AND PX. We have told the PUC we do not want to duplicate the efforts of ISOand PX so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give  only missingdata. PRO:  It would be easier and quicker to just give the outside ofCalifornia data and would sidestep for the moment the ongoing jurisdictional question.  Con:  Without Enroncost data for the California ISO and PX transactions, the PUC would not be able to arrive at what they want -- a profit and losspicture.  We would have a hard time representing to the PUC that  thecombination of the PUC data and the Enron data would be all that they needto calculate the answers to Request Nos. 7-10.4. TURN OVER EVERYTHING BUT PRICE This option would simple omit the price data.  Pro:  It would notreveal the profit and loss information.  Con:  It would not reveal theprofit and loss information.  In other words, the PUC is clear that this iswhat they are after.  By giving them everything else, we would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit andloss.  Moreover, by piecing some of it together with the ISO and PXdata, the PUC might be able to put together a revenue picture which will bequite large, but just not the cost or expense side.5. DECLINE TO PRODUCE THE DATA We would tell Harvey Morris that Enron has reconsidered its positionfor the following reasons:  (1) Our firm belief that the PUC is  notentitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking; (2) in his latestemail, Harvey has made it clear that the PUC wants more  data (1999)than we discussed earlier; (3) continued threat that if they do not like thetransaction data they will come back and  ask for profit and lossinformation that we do not believe they are entitled to; (4) CommissionerWood s statement that the purpose  of this investigation is to getmoney from market participants in the hands of consumers; (5) investigationby the AG into activities  of other market participants and the noticethat other governmental agencies are cooperating -- who are we producingthis  information to and for what purpose; (6) Enron favors publicdisclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required todo so; (7) Enron is a small player in this market and many other marketparticipants are not involved in the process BPA etc.    PRO:  Thismay be the only way to preserve Enron s challenge to the jurisdiction of thePUC to get this data.  Moreover, in the  current politicalenvironment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked.  Italso makes sense to see what FERC  will do with their published 11/1/00report on investigation date. Under this option, we file our formalobjections and sit back and  wait.6. ME TOO Upon reflection, we agree with the approach taken by the othermarket participants.  We will not produce until the protective order  ismodified and then only data that is within the PUC jurisdiction.  PRO:  Thismakes it look like all the market participants are  acting in concertand really is no different than option 1 above.  Moreover, if you readReliant s responses, they appear ready to  turn over financial data ifthe protective order is modified. (Terry and Mike Day are both out of theiroffices today.)  Note that  Williams is adopting a strategy that saysthe PUC needs to go to Superior Court to enforce its subpoena.  This may bemet with  strong opposition by the PUC given their Californiaconstitutional contempt authority.7. MOVE TO QUASH BEFORE THE ALJ Here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why thePUC does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits  before theALJ.  PRO:  The ALJ is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions.  Ithas the least procedural risks of being  dismissed.  CON:  Readingthe tea leaves, we believe it unlikely that the ALJ will determine that thePUC has no jurisdiction. Moreover, because the PUC has its own constitutionally grantedcontempt power, the PUC will take the view (according to Mike  Day) thatthey need not go to the Superior Court for enforcement.  They will also takethe view that the Superior Court has no  jurisdiction  to hear ourappeal.  Appeals have to go to the PUC and those orders are appealable atthe Court of Appeal level.   Thus, the only de novo review of ourobjections might be at the ALJ level.8. FILE DECLARATORY RELIEF ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA We would claim federal question jurisdiction under the Federal PowerAct and in particular the provisions of 824(g) under which the PUCissued its subpoena in part.  The dispute to be decided is whether the PUChas the jurisdiction to seek the profit and  loss information from thewholesale market.  The authority for this would be Mississippi Power & Lightv. Mississippi  487 US  354 (bright line between wholesale market regulatedby FERC and the retail market regulated by states); Bristol Energy Corp v.New Hampshire 13 F.3d 471 (1st Cir. 1994)(federal question whether stateagency can inquire into business and financial data  in the wholesalemarket but found no cognizable claim.)  PRO:  The federal forum may be moreeven handed than the ALJ, but  the question is whether we can state acognizable claim.  There may be greater protections from disclosure of theinformation as  well.  CON:  The PUC may continue on a parallel track unlesswe are able to obtain injunctive relief.  The PUC might seek  discovery ofthe same information in the Federal court proceeding.  We should assume thatthis action will trigger the strongest  response from the PUC and/or the AGin form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the sameinformation (e.g  unfair business practice suit, price gouging,anti-trust etc.).   We should anticipate deposition requests for tradersetc.  By taking  this position, we will clearly be conceding that ifFERC asks for the data it is germane to their authority.9. SEPARATE RESPONSES/STRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT ENRON ENTITIES It may make some sense to chart a different course for PortlandGeneral, EES and EEMC and continue to produce some data from  thoseentities.  PRO:  The information provided for these entities is not likelyto generate profit and loss information that would be  germane to the fightwe are about to engage in (e.g. EES s description of % off tariff rates forexample.)  For Portland General,  Dave Aamodt is out of the office andnot able to participate in any change of direction discussions.Hope this is helpful.ThanksGary=======================================================This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

ExxonMobil, Shell,==20and Chevron have all missed output targets, despite the incentive of two=20years of high oil prices. ExxonMobil planned a 3% annual growth target last==20year but its output for the second quarter of 2001 was flat versus a year==20ago. Shell reported that its 2nd quarter production increased by only 1%,==20well short of the 5% target. Depletion from existing oil fields runs at an==20average rate of about 5% per year, and that has to be replaced by an=20equivalent amount of new production just to keep output steady. From 1998 t=o=202000 the six biggest publicly traded companies largely failed to replace th=e=20oil and natural gas they produced with new reserves, after stripping out th=e=20effect of acquisitions and revisions, according to Andersen management=20consulting. BP posted one of the best performances, replacing 200% of its==20natural gas production and 86% of its oil. Shell replaced only 42% of its==20natural gas and 55% of its oil, according to Andersen. BP has set the most==20ambitious production growth target of 5.5% for this year up 7% for the long=er=20term.=20From http://www.enerfax.com (Sunday, August 19, 2001):=20Natural Gas Futures Dip Lower    Natural gas futures for September delivery on the NYMEX dipped $0.064 l=ower Friday to $3.303 per MMBtu as traders squared short positions now that= Tropical Storm Chantal will miss the GulfCoast. The October contract lost =$0.081 to $3.334 per MMBtu. Tropical Storm Chantal will affect the YucatanP=eninsulaearly this week and then move into the central Gulf but is a noneve=nt. Some traders wanted their positions cleared in preparation for next wee=k s AGA storage report as they do not trust last week s reported build of j=ust 3 Bcf, and believe that the AGA may report a higher build this week to =compensate. A lot of traders got burned by last week s report and are begin=ning to doubt the whole system. But, others look at the data as just a one-=week blip brought about by a crescendo of events that no longer exist and d=o represent not a long-term shift. However, if Wednesday s AGA injection is= low again this week, look for the market to rally to a higher level, but i=n the meantime it will be controlled by the storm entering the Gulf of Mexi=co. Look for support in the $3.15-$3.20 range and again at $3.00. Resistanc=e is pegged at $3.40 and again around $3.60. Natural gas for next day deliv=ery across the USand Canadawas generally $0.10 - $0.20 lower Friday. Natura=l gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub dropped $0.20 to $3.24 per MMB=tu.=20Gulf South Hold Open Season for Gulf Pines Pipeline=20   =20    Gulf South Pipeline is planning to build a pipeline extending from Mobi=leBayto North Carolinaif it receives enough interest. An open season for ca=pacity on the Gulf Pines Pipeline is being currently being held. Gulf South= Pipeline, formerly Koch Gateway Pipeline, is owned by Entergy-Koch. If com=pleted, Gulf Pines would be 600 - 700 miles long, and would extend through =Georgia, South Carolinaand North Carolina. Anticipating an in-service date =of summer 2004, Gulf South is soliciting binding and non-binding bids for c=apacity on Gulf Pines through September 19th. The pipeline would offer an i=nterconnection with Gulf South near MobileBay, allowing customers to source= supply from Texasand Louisianaas well as from MobileBay. The Gulf South sy=stem also offers links to major storage and supply hubs.=20Gas Daily reports this proposed pipeline may have a capacity of 1 bcf per d=ay.  It also gives the following website for additional information:  http:=//www.gulfpinespipeline.com .=20Natural Gas Market Ponders Storage Report =20    While some were questioning the accuracy of this week s astonishingly l=ow natural gas storage report, others blamed Tropical Storm Barry and highe=r demands from new power generation load. However, both the futures and cas=h markets jumped. Futures closed up $0.374 the day the report was announced=, and the cash market rose $0.20 - $0.40 the day after. Some chose to not b=elieve the 3 Bcf storage fill reported by the AGA, chalking it up to bad da=ta. The average amount injected during a week in August is over 60 Bcf. The= prior week s fill was 80 Bcf. Factoring in Barry and the prolonged heat wa=ve that week, the market had been expecting a somewhat lower number, but al=l had predicted something above 50 Bcf. There are various reports and theor=ies. Buyers for northeastern utilities said they had all injected and were =shocked by the minus 12 Bcf storage number reported for the East. They coul=d not entirely dismiss it, however. They noted that in the last 4 years all= the new plants that have been built are natural gas only facilities. Last =week could have been a good indication of what that could mean to the marke=t. The AGA says they checked and re-checked when they came up with the unbe=lievable number. The AGA s numbers have always lined up with the more exten=sive EIA reports. It is possible that a number of factors came together all= at once, with the impact of Barry on production and an higher generation l=oads because of Eastern heat wave.

The transport delivery off HPLC was shorted to keepEntex whole on a minimum purchase from ENA. Originally this transport imbalance was to be clearedthe next month in May of 1999. Some of the imbalance was cleared in May of 1999, but 91,297 MMBtustill remains as a imbalance on this contract. We need to monitor the IFHSC Index for the upcoming monthsso that when one is compatible with the IFHSC Index of April of 1999 we can clear this imbalance. We willneed to allocated 91,297 MMBtu extra to the transport. This will reduce the purchase from ENA by 91,297 MMBtu for that month.

deliver,"HEADLINE: ?Calif. Governor To Address StateBYLINE: JENNIFER COLEMANDATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.BODY:???While Gov. Gray Davis prepared to speak to the state Thursday night aboutCalifornia s energy crisis, economic forecasters predicted the power crunchwould lead to higher taxes and scrapped public projects.??Davis said Wednesday he hadn t written his five-minute address, but that heplanned to discuss   the progress that we ve made and what we have to getthrough.  ??Among other things, he was expected to talk about the more than 40 percentrate increases approved last week by the Public Utilities Commission forcustomers of the state s two largest utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. andSouthern California Edison Co. He has asked California television stations tocarry his remarks live.??California has been hit with rolling blackouts and tight power suppliesblamed in part on soaring wholesale electricity costs.??On Wednesday, the state got more bad economic news: The UCLA AndersonBusiness Forecast said Californians would face higher taxes and a tighter statebudget because of the billions of state dollars being spent on emergency power.The blackouts and the state s scrutiny of private power suppliers also threatento scare away new businesses, the report said.??Facing continued refusal from federal energy regulators to cap high energyprices, Davis said Wednesday he would be willing to support a windfall-profitstax on electric generators that have made a fortune selling power to Californiathis year.??A bill to that effect was introduced Wednesday in the state Assembly. Itwould tax gross receipts that   significantly exceed   the cost of producingpower and tax profits of power marketers who have bought power and later sold itat much higher rates.??  We continue to allow some electricity generators and middlemen to reapenormous profits on their sales of electricity into the state. This profiteeringmust stop,   Democratic Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett said.??Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said he doubted a tax on a selectedindustry would be legal. He added that such a tax would discourage generatorsfrom building new power plants in California.??  The governor has made very clear that he is trying to do whatever he can toincrease the amount of generation in California and reduce the price.Windfall-profits taxes do neither of these,   Williams said.??Davis said he generally opposes treating profitable companies in that manner,  but these profits are outrageous and are at our expense. The only thingscompanies understand is leverage.  ??For the first time, Davis also said the state should let companies buy theirpower from generators instead of going through the utilities.??The Utility Reform Network and the head of the PUC oppose the idea. Theyargue residential customers and small businesses unable to contract withgenerators would get stuck with the bill for the billions of dollars the statehas and will spend buying electricity for the customers of the cash-strappedutilities.HEADLINE:  Chaos  in state electricity planningBYLINE: By Rick JurgensBODY:??LOS ANGELES _ Two hundred of the finest economic minds in California gatheredWednesday at UCLA s Anderson School of Management to discuss the state s energycrisis but, as state Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch spoke,the power to her microphone cut out intermittently and unexpectedly.??""I don t have any control over this,"" the beleaguered technician operatingthe sound system called out after repeated outages.??""I feel your pain,"" Lynch replied with a smile.??No one in the audience doubted that. After two rounds of rolling blackoutsthat state officials were powerless to prevent, Lynch last week led thecommission to hike retail power rates 42 percent, sparking protests fromconsumer groups.??But at UCLA Lynch had power and natural gas producers in her sights. Shepromised to lead ""a war against the sellers who are taking so much value out ofthe California economy and not adding a whit of value.""??Lynch said she favored reinstatement of wholesale price caps that were endedby the Federal Energy Rate Commission in December but wasn t counting on that.??Even without those caps, she said she was optimistic that the state hadenough tools to restrain price hikes by wholesalers and avoid another rate hike.??Those tools include conservation, purchases of long-term power contracts bythe Department of Water Resources, utility cost cutting and making sure thesmall power producers known as qualifying facilities are online, she said.??Lynch dismissed the state s 1996 deregulation plan as a ""failed experiment""and said she did not accept a questioner s premise that ""true deregulation isour goal."" The problem was that ""the state stepped back too much"" frommanagement of the power system and that there had been ""too much ideology andtheory and not enough practical solutions,"" she added.??A panel of experts offered some grim predictions. ""We are expecting severedifficulties for this summer and next summer,"" said Barry Sedlik, a SouthernCalifornia Edison manager.??Mark Bernstein, an analyst with the Rand Corp. in Santa Monica, said theelectricity problems are spreading. ""This may go on for a while and it s notjust California,"" he said. ""In the near term we ve got chaos,"" he added.??But he offered one macabre ray of hope. He said that federal policymakers may feel more urgency to step in if, as now appears possible, rolling blackouts occur in 2002 in Florida where, he didn t need to add, President Bush s brother is governor.??Problems with the transmission system there, as well as generation shortage,could hurt Florida but the state has enough time to avoid a crisis, he said inan interview."

Hopefully, since we are only talking about a high pressure tap,NCNG will have less leverage.Jeffrey and I did talk about amending the application some time ago;  heexpressed the concern that the description of the generators might bemisleading unless either more or less data were supplied, and he suggesteddescribing them more generally.  I think he was confortable with the factthat the CPCN will be reviewed by electrical engineers who understand thegenerators described without the elaboration he thought necessary.One of the problems with amending the application is that you run the riskthat the Commission will adjust the time frames for intervention, etc.,accordingly.

If it is, then whatobligation does NCNG have with respect to the construction of a deliverypoint.  I haven t reviewed the annexation statutes yet, but based on myinitial reading of the Service Area Territory Agreement between Rocky Mountand NCNG, once annexed the site would come within Rocky Mount s purview toserve, and, although a ""mutually agreeable"" delivery point would have to benegotiated, NCNG would at least have to negotiate that in good faith.The January 13, 1992 Service Area Territory Agreement gives Rocky Mount theright to distribute natural gas within the city s incorporated limits aswell as a specified area outside the incorporated limits.   The contractgoes on to provide that should any part of that perimeter be annexed intothe city, ""the respective rights of the parties as to service in any suchportion shall be determined by applicable case law and the General Statutesof North Carolina. . .""  The contract further provides that absent an orderof the NCUC to the contrary, NCNG agrees that Rocky Mount has the right toserve all end users within the ""aforementioned"" area--presumably referringto the annexed area, although the agreement is not a model of clarity.So, at least based on this language, Rocky Mount s right to serve arguablytracks its incorporated limits, whatever they might be.  (Jonathan and Iarelooking at annexation law to see what else might be lurking out there).The 1992 Service agreement provides, In Article IV, provides that points ofdevliery for all natural gas purchased or transported under the agreementwith NCNG shall be ""at the following locations and other stations added atmutually agreeable locations in the future. . ."" In the Third Amendment tothe Natural Gas Service Agreement, dated March 10, 1997, new language anddelivery points are negotiated upon, but the principle is still includedthat  other stations may be added at ""mutually agreeable locations in thefuture.""  The question which then arises is what Rocky Mount would have togive in exchange.  In the 1997 agreement, Rocky Mount agreed to anextentionof terms of the of ten years, until December 6,"

deliver,"X-FileName: andy zipper 6-26-02.PSTTo summarize where we are on the accounting issues related to booking all of the income related to our 12.5% equity investment in Kiodex in Q1:The 12.5% equity investment has to be a completely separate transaction from the co-marketing arrangement for which we are paid in warrants.Kiodex cannot clawback or redeem any portion of the 12.5% if Enron walks the co-marketing agreement at any point in the five-year term.  It is ours to keep.The 12.5% equity investment will be collapsed with the co-marketing deal (and therefore income can only be realized over the five-year term) if there isn t enough consideration for the 12.5% to make it look like a real deal.  Mike Patrick believes that we can get the desired accounting treatment for the 12.5% if we deliver promotional materials to our customers and EnronOnline ""statistics"" as consideration for the 12.5%.  We have not really spelled out exactly what this consideration is, but I have attached a draft stock purchase agreement in which we have attempted to do so in Section 5.11.Kiodex wants to close this deal by March 7; we probably can t get the consideration in line by then, but we probably could by the end of the quarter.  Kiodex wasn t crazy about giving us the 12.5% for anything less than the 5-year marketing agreement, and wanted a clawback on the shares even then; they sure won t give us 12.5% for a promise to deliver the consideration by the end of March.  This means we will have to close the deal into escrow, and can get the shares when we deliver the consideration.Here are the questions for the deal team:1.	  What can we give to Kiodex before the end of Q1 that supports our 12.5% equity investment.  I can describe the promotional materials, but what ""statistics"" can we provide that will be valuable to Kiodex?  (Remember that Kiodex will have to feel like they are getting SOMETHING for the 12.5% equity they are giving us, because again, it will be ours to keep regardless of what happens to the co-marketing agreement).2.	 Whatever we decide to give to Kiodex for the 12.5%, we will have to be able to deliver it IN FULL by the end of Q1; otherwise, we can t get our shares, and we can t book the income.Here is the stock purchase agreement; I wam working on the language in Section 5.11, but it gives you an idea of what we think we might be able to do.

We also have projects in Goergia (Hartwell and Athens) that are probably 70%, and Louisiana (Calcasieu and St Charles) that are 50%. I would put Midway at 90%. The non-Florida opportunities would be used to package with the turbines and flip a la Pastoria. We have strong interest in Georgia in particular, and have received a written offer from FPL to purchase the development assets of Hartwell and Athens for $4.4 million (no equip. included).I would presume we would put the turbines back on the market in Q1 of  02 if we do not proceed with any Florida opportunities. I think the downside is approximately $2 million per unit (given that that is our effective premium being offered today), but that we have a natural hedge on this downside as we have a high chance of recouping any downside by combining the turbines with any of the development assets listed above (they have all been permitted for 7FAs, although not all permits have been received). -----Original Message-----From:  Schneider, Chip  Sent: Friday, June 01, 2001 9:52 AMTo: Jacoby, Ben; Mann, KayCc: Deffner, Joseph; Duran, W.

(E-mail)"" <richard.b.sanders@enron.com>		 cc: ""Meringolo, Peter"" <PMeringolo@brobeck.com>		 Subject: Some thoughts on optionsPRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIALATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGERichard, After today s discussion here are our brainstorming ideas onoptions:1.   WAIT FOR A BETTER PROTECTIVE ORDER Ask Harvey Morris where they are on fixing the protective order thatis being litigated by others.  If the protective order has not  changed,then unilaterally postpone production until it is.  Pro: Better protectionand more time; Con: Even with a more stringent protective order Enron still questions whether the PUC is entitledto financial performance data.  Thus, this option does not fullydisclose all of Enron s positions and the company may be accused later ofsimply engaging in delaying tactics.  Under this option  we file ourformal objections as well.2. TURN OVER THE TRANSACTION DATA AS IS Continue on our present course of turning over transaction data forelectricity that was delivered.  Pro: PUC will get the data  anywayeither through FERC, unfair competition, antitrust or price gouginglitigation.  By turning over the data that will show  profits, PUC mightslow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business byseeking to depose witnesses etc.  Con:  This would be waiving thelegitimate question that Enron has as to the PUC s ability to discovery thisinformation through a  subpoena.  There is also a question of howconfidential this data would be given the current political agenda.  Itmight also serve  to whet the appetite of the PUC for more Enroninformation and discovery.   This option would also provide confidentialproprietary information to the PUC about how Enron gets its competitiveadvantage.3. TURN OVER DATA FOR OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND LET PUC GET REST OFDATA FROM ISO AND PX. We have told the PUC we do not want to duplicate the efforts of ISOand PX so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give  only missingdata. PRO:  It would be easier and quicker to just give the outside ofCalifornia data and would sidestep for the moment the ongoing jurisdictional question.  Con:  Without Enroncost data for the California ISO and PX transactions, the PUC would not be able to arrive at what they want -- a profit and losspicture.  We would have a hard time representing to the PUC that  thecombination of the PUC data and the Enron data would be all that they needto calculate the answers to Request Nos. 7-10.4. TURN OVER EVERYTHING BUT PRICE This option would simple omit the price data.  Pro:  It would notreveal the profit and loss information.  Con:  It would not reveal theprofit and loss information.  In other words, the PUC is clear that this iswhat they are after.  By giving them everything else, we would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit andloss.  Moreover, by piecing some of it together with the ISO and PXdata, the PUC might be able to put together a revenue picture which will bequite large, but just not the cost or expense side.5. DECLINE TO PRODUCE THE DATA We would tell Harvey Morris that Enron has reconsidered its positionfor the following reasons:  (1) Our firm belief that the PUC is  notentitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking; (2) in his latestemail, Harvey has made it clear that the PUC wants more  data (1999)than we discussed earlier; (3) continued threat that if they do not like thetransaction data they will come back and  ask for profit and lossinformation that we do not believe they are entitled to; (4) CommissionerWood s statement that the purpose  of this investigation is to getmoney from market participants in the hands of consumers; (5) investigationby the AG into activities  of other market participants and the noticethat other governmental agencies are cooperating -- who are we producingthis  information to and for what purpose; (6) Enron favors publicdisclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required todo so; (7) Enron is a small player in this market and many other marketparticipants are not involved in the process BPA etc.    PRO:  Thismay be the only way to preserve Enron s challenge to the jurisdiction of thePUC to get this data.  Moreover, in the  current politicalenvironment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked.  Italso makes sense to see what FERC  will do with their published 11/1/00report on investigation date. Under this option, we file our formalobjections and sit back and  wait.6. ME TOO Upon reflection, we agree with the approach taken by the othermarket participants.  We will not produce until the protective order  ismodified and then only data that is within the PUC jurisdiction.  PRO:  Thismakes it look like all the market participants are  acting in concertand really is no different than option 1 above.  Moreover, if you readReliant s responses, they appear ready to  turn over financial data ifthe protective order is modified. (Terry and Mike Day are both out of theiroffices today.)  Note that  Williams is adopting a strategy that saysthe PUC needs to go to Superior Court to enforce its subpoena.  This may bemet with  strong opposition by the PUC given their Californiaconstitutional contempt authority.7. MOVE TO QUASH BEFORE THE ALJ Here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why thePUC does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits  before theALJ.  PRO:  The ALJ is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions.  Ithas the least procedural risks of being  dismissed.  CON:  Readingthe tea leaves, we believe it unlikely that the ALJ will determine that thePUC has no jurisdiction. Moreover, because the PUC has its own constitutionally grantedcontempt power, the PUC will take the view (according to Mike  Day) thatthey need not go to the Superior Court for enforcement.  They will also takethe view that the Superior Court has no  jurisdiction  to hear ourappeal.  Appeals have to go to the PUC and those orders are appealable atthe Court of Appeal level.   Thus, the only de novo review of ourobjections might be at the ALJ level.8. FILE DECLARATORY RELIEF ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA We would claim federal question jurisdiction under the Federal PowerAct and in particular the provisions of 824(g) under which the PUCissued its subpoena in part.  The dispute to be decided is whether the PUChas the jurisdiction to seek the profit and  loss information from thewholesale market.  The authority for this would be Mississippi Power & Lightv. Mississippi  487 US  354 (bright line between wholesale market regulatedby FERC and the retail market regulated by states); Bristol Energy Corp v.New Hampshire 13 F.3d 471 (1st Cir. 1994)(federal question whether stateagency can inquire into business and financial data  in the wholesalemarket but found no cognizable claim.)  PRO:  The federal forum may be moreeven handed than the ALJ, but  the question is whether we can state acognizable claim.  There may be greater protections from disclosure of theinformation as  well.  CON:  The PUC may continue on a parallel track unlesswe are able to obtain injunctive relief.  The PUC might seek  discovery ofthe same information in the Federal court proceeding.  We should assume thatthis action will trigger the strongest  response from the PUC and/or the AGin form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the sameinformation (e.g  unfair business practice suit, price gouging,anti-trust etc.).   We should anticipate deposition requests for tradersetc.  By taking  this position, we will clearly be conceding that ifFERC asks for the data it is germane to their authority.9. SEPARATE RESPONSES/STRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT ENRON ENTITIES It may make some sense to chart a different course for PortlandGeneral, EES and EEMC and continue to produce some data from  thoseentities.  PRO:  The information provided for these entities is not likelyto generate profit and loss information that would be  germane to the fightwe are about to engage in (e.g. EES s description of % off tariff rates forexample.)  For Portland General,  Dave Aamodt is out of the office andnot able to participate in any change of direction discussions.Hope this is helpful.ThanksGary=======================================================This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

I suggest that you compare Elena and Sarah s duties/ level to other Sr. Spec. in your group such as Kenneth Parkhill and Sevil to determine if they are equivalent, or if their scope of responsibilities and experience is not as broad.

In my discussions with Audrey, she expressed a hope that Enron would be able to support the filing and that she d like to open a dialogue on how to get our support.  I indicated that there were at least 2 issues that would be of concern for us---support for one RTO and support for one tariff within that RTO.  Although she was open and probably even supportive of one RTO in the midwest, there is a separate tariff for any delivery within the Translink system within her proposal.  SHe described that tariff as being different than the Detroit Edison case that you guys filed against.  I confirmed that the publics who are in the transco (NPPD, OPPD, Cornbelt) would not agree to be in the transco without the separate tariff.I have sent via overnight a copy of materials on the transco to both of you.  I told her that Donna was that lead on the Midwest team, and that you d be willing to talk/meet with her.  If practical, it would be good if you could call her in the next few days for a number of reasons---1.) I am sure that Xcel is planning a similiar transco for the west and if you can get a better sense of whether we are on any of the same pages, it would be good to have that input for our western discussion on Wednesday in Houston  2.) she is one of the panelists for RTO week, so you might be able to set up a time in D.C. that you could meet in person  3.) you might be able to get a sense of what she will be talking about at RTO week on her panel.Here is her info:  		Audrey Zibelman				VIce President				Xcel Energy				Independent Transmission COmpany				414 Nicollet Mall  6th FLoor				Minneapolis, MN  55401				audrey.a.zibelman@xcelenergy.com				#612-330-7713"

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman James Hoecker Thursday asked Congress to give the commission new authority to order refunds in the event of electricity price gouging. Hoecker sought the retroactive ratemaking authority in the context of the commission s investigation of power market volatility in California this summer, where prices for San Diego consumers have more than doubled from last year. Congress should give FERC ""authority to retroactively correct extraordinary wealth transfers that can happen when prices unexpectedly skyrocket and consumers cannot get out of the way,"" Hoecker told the House Government Reform Committee. The commission, in response to a petition from San Diego Gas&Electric Co., a unit of Sempra Energy (SRE), has ordered a staff investigation of the market situation in California. FERC will order refunds if it determines that power producers have obtained ""unjust or unreasonable"" prices for the power they sold into California electricity markets overseen by the state s power exchange and independent system operator, Hoecker said. But under the Federal Power Act, FERC can t order any refunds beyond the Aug. 23 date of its order setting the investigation, the nation s chief energy regulator noted. ""We do not now have that authority,"" he said. ""The commission staff is hard at work on completing its fact-finding investigation. Based on the staff report to the commission, we will be prepared to take further measures, as appropriate,"" Hoecker testified. ""The commission expects its actions and the measures adopted by the state will moderate price volatility in California markets,"" he said.

We believe this> information will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for the> staff s purposes.>> FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS> Requests 7 through 11>>  The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period> requested with respect to financial data.

We anticipate producing public> filings regarding financial data on October 13, 2000 and the electronic> Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions.>> GENERATING DOCUMENTS> Requests 12, 14 and 18>>  For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation> facilities are either non-existent or limited in number and there will> probably be limited documents available.  The Enron Entities to the extent> they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or> resell generation output, do not have the specific documents that pertain> to each generation unit requested.  The Enron Entities, other than> Portland General, do have documents and information for Las Vegas> Cogeneration.  We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of> document productions.>>   For Portland General, the production of the requested documents> would involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General owned> twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.> Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about> one half of its total energy demand.  As a result, we question whether the> effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the> California wholesale market is necessarily limited.  Nevertheless,> Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000 electronic Transaction> Documents in summary form similar to the data being provided by other> Enron Entities, to the extent relevant as discussed below.  We propose> that the Commission defer requesting production of other information until> it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant> proportion of their energy into the California market.  At that time a> more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will> be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the> California wholesale market.>> TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS> Requests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19>>  We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for> the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and> PX.  EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of relevant> transaction data for year 2000 (in California and outside of California> and Real Time) for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the> date, counterparty, quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it> is a purchase or a sale.   Because of the speed with which you want this> information, it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or> inaccurate.  For those> transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, we> understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there will> not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide> quickly.  The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to> EPMI s customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading> business.  EES can also provide similar data with respect to relevant> wholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect to> retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail> customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES > confidentiality obligations to those customers.  We anticipate producing> the Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions.>> FERC DOCUMENTS>> Request 20>>  The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received> from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of> those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October> 13, 2000.>>>  Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron> Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on> Friday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities could> make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for> production by then.>>  We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if> any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one> currently in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions> will be protected by the most stringent protective order.  In addition,> if, at the request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the> Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests> for production be limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities> reserve the right to limit the production of documents in conformance with> such order.>>  We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know> if they are acceptable to the Commission.

request,"Allyson,As you know, we have had discussions with the City of Rocky Mount regarding possibly buying gas from them for the new power plant in Edgecombe County.  Evidently, the gas company has figured this out, and is not happy with this prospect.  We would like your opinion concerning the City s ability to (a) require that a tap be made so that the power plant be served and (b) sell gas to Enron for this purpose.  When considering these issues, please assume that the City would own and annex the land, and lease it to an Enron entity.We will need the gas by next March or April, so time is critical.  Should the gas company decline, what is the appeal process and how long can it be expected to take?  Do you  have any suggestions for expediting the process?I am having the contracts between the gas company and the City sent to you, and you should have them by Monday.Thank you for your assistance,Kay"

Since arbitration is the final stage in the dispute resolution process agreed by the parties and it has been agreed that there should be continuity until any dispute is finally resolved, this position should properly apply to each stage of the dispute resolution process. I suggest that since the dispute resolution procedure envisages continuity, until resolution, that Consumers should continue to invoice on the basis that they have done for the last few years. Richard, we will need your input as to whether we could argue the above with a sufficient degree of confidence to persuade a judge to make an order of specific performance as against Consumers to invoice using the basis that they have been using for the last few years, pending outcome of the dispute resolution process. Further, whether you believe that we will be entitled to seek such equitable relief. We need to take control of this process and ensure that Consumers are always playing catch-up, if we fail to do so we will be playing catch-up and will be out of pocket until the conclusion of the arbitration process. If we do not get Consumers to invoice and pay the sums we believe are due, there will be no incentive on Consumers to start the process and every opportunity for them to delay any resolution of this dispute. I have spoken with Sandy Hollingsworth who will be sending me copies of documents that Dynegy have uncovered which she believes further assist our case. Once I receive them we ought to meet to review and obtain a better understanding of the case we are able to make and the case which may be made against us. Is there any other evidence that we, or Dynegy, should be collecting at this stage, such as interviewing individuals who were involved in the negotiations/discussions with Consumers?

Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer that can take around 1,000 day.  I don t know if that s dt or mcf.  I will use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.  This customer has a special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the customer pulls.  For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf credited back to your imbalance account the following month.  I don t know how this works with trading imbalances.  But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works out to $.21 - sounds good to me.  Paul said this customer is looking for a CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.  Marde will not sell at that price but I will.Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.  Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, settle up financially with EES and be done with it.  What we could do to test Paul s statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES s pool for July.  It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.

deliver,"Heather:Here is an excerpt from a message in which Anita Fam replies to my inquiry:Only 3 types of institutions have the capacity and authority to enter into derivatives transactions in the PRC.  They are:a. banks;b. non-bank financial institutions (""NBFI""); andc. foreign invested enterprises (""FIE"").Banks and NBFIs require banking licences and may only enter into derivative transactions for hedging purposes.  FIEs comprise (i) wholly foreign owned enterprises (""WFOE""); and (ii) sino-foreign owned joint ventures (""SFJV"") and include foreign banks, foreign finance companies and bank branches . There are no specific restrictions for WFOEs but SFJVs may only enter into derivative transactions for hedging purposes as well.    State-owned enterprises and collectively-owned enterprises  can therefore only transact through a duly authorised bank or NBFI.  So it looks as if China National Oil Company (Corp.?) and China State Power Corp. do not have the capacity nor the authority to enter into derivative transactions themselves in the PRC.I have also found a copy of the results of some legal research we had done a year or two ago on these issues.  If you or Cynthia would like to see it I d be happy to send a copy on."

From:  Sally Beck                           01/05/2001 09:27 AM	To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Re: Benchmarking Study  I passed this information along to some of my direct reports for their thoughts, and truthfully didn t hear back from anyone and didn t follow up.  Two years ago, we agreed to be part of a benchmarking study that was done by AA s Houston office (interestingly enough, Wes Colwell was the AA partner who led this effort) and we had mixed results.  The study was designed to cover gas and power.  Despite our involvement in the steering committee, the study itself was very, very detailed, such that it was troublesome to complete.  Jim Fallon at the time refused to submit information on the majority of the questions surrounding power, so our survey data for power was not very useful.  I would agree that at this time we will pass on this request.  Thanks for passing it along, however.  I would be happy to convey this directly  to the person that has contacted you.  Just let me know his/her name and number and I will follow through on that if you would like.  Hope that your holidays was enjoyable and that the new year will be a good one for you.  --Sally  Vince J Kaminski01/03/2001 03:29 PMTo: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Benchmarking StudySally,I gave you some time ago a brochure on this benchmarking study request.They renewed their request for Enron s participation.What is your view on this?
